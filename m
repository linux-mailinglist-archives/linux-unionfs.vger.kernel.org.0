Hi Amir, Vivek,

Thanks for the replies, I think I now have a better understanding of
the concerns which is starting to make the path forward a bit more
clear.  A few more comments below ...

Yes, of course.  I'll be sure to add a section to the existing docs.

Definitely.  Most of what I've been thinking about the past day or so
has been how to properly handle some of the DAC/capability issues; I
have yet to start playing with the code, but for the most part I think
the MAC/SELinux bits are already working properly.

I have thoughts on this, but I don't think I'm yet in a position to
debate this in depth just yet; I still need to finish poking around
the code and playing with a few things :)

It may take some time before I'm back with patches, but I appreciate
all of the tips and insight - thank you!
