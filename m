Well, the key point of fsverity is that data is not verified until it is
actually read.  At open time, the fsverity file digest is made available in
constant time, and overlayfs will verify that.  However, invalid data blocks are
not reported until the data is actually read.  The error that applications get
is EIO for syscalls, and SIGBUS for memory-mapped reads, as mentioned at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html#accessing-verity-files

So overlayfs might report EIO at open time, or it might not report an error
until the modified data is read.  And in the latter case, presumably the error
seen by the application matches the one for using fsverity natively?

You can link to the fsverity documentation somewhere if it would be helpful, but
I'd still like the semantics of how this works on overlayfs to be documented.
