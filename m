No parallelism required.
The side effect is to reduce the attack/fuzzing vector for creating
bad things by deleting/renaming lower dentries.

Yes, but it has nothing to do with races it has only to do with
use cases (see blow).

Today, if a user deletes/renames underlying lower that leaves
the overlayfs dentry in a vulnerable state.
I do not have a reproducer to OOPS the kernel with that, but
syzbot has created some crashes of similar nature in the past.

The fact is that all we can say about this scenario is:
"If the underlying filesystem is changed, the behavior of the overlay
 is undefined, though it will not result in a crash or deadlock."
and that second part cannot be proven to be true.

With the set of these two patches, a whole class of attacks is
pruned, because every attack that needs to get the vulnerable
denry via lookup will not get it. Attacks that use a fd to access
a vulnerable dentry may still work.

The confusing part about racing with ovl_unlink()/ovl_rmdir()
is not really important. It explains that an overlay dentry in the
middle of ovl_rmdir() (after vfs_rmdir() and before d_drop()) can
be found by parallel dcache lookup and "appear" like an underlying
change (upper was removed under the overlay).

I only mentioned that because we must not return -ESTALE in
that case, but if we remove the -ESTALE conversion, nothing bad will
happen. dcache lookup will get 0 from ovl_revalidate on that dentry
and re-do the lookup, which is exactly what would have happened
if lookup took place a few ms later after ovl_rmdir() called d_drop().

Thanks,
Amir.
