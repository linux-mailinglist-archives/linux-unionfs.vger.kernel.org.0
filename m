Yeah, but those whiteouts are not the target of this work. An OCI
image is a set of tarballs, and one tarball can contain magically
marked ".wh." prefixed files for whiteouts. These are converted to
real whiteouts by docker. However, suppose the image itself contains
an overlayfs lower directory, which the app in the container wants to
use. This would look like a chardev(0,0) (not a .wh.*) in the tarball.
If this is naively extracted to disk (without escaping) then those
whiteouts will not be visible to the container app when it runs in the
container, because the outer overlayfs ate them.

Such whiteouts in OCI containers don't currently work, so you won't
find any such OCI containers in the wild. But with escapes it seems
useful. Something similar that you *will* find in the wild however, is
ostree images with whiteouts in them, and we want to keep supporting
these. See more below.

One of the goals is to use composefs as a backend for ostree (instead
of hardlinked trees). And ostree images with whiteouts in them are
pretty common (typically from os images with preinstalled container
images).

If mkfs.composefs converted these to xattr whiteouts it may work when
you run the containers in the image. But its not ideal if the content
of the rootfs depends on the ostree backend, and its quite possible
that some existing tooling will be confused by the new whiteouts.

Yeah, that is true for the whiteouts, but not the escaped whiteouts.
It's a bit confusing, so let me give an example:

Suppose I have this file structure with a 2 layer overlayfs with an xwhiteo=
ut.

=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 layer1
=E2=94=82   =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 dir
=E2=94=82       =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 file
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 layer2
    =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 dir - overlay.whiteouts
        =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 file - overlay.whiteout

(At this point, it is true what you say. If a layer3/dir existed
without "overlay.whiteouts", things would still work.)

Now I want to store this structure as the first layer inside another
overlayfs by escaping the xattrs, it would look like this:

layerA
=E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 layer1
=E2=94=82   =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 dir
=E2=94=82       =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 file
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 layer2
    =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 dir - overlay.overlay.whiteouts
        =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 file - overlay.overlay.whiteout
layerB
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 layer2
    =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 dir
        =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 new-file

You'd use it like this:
 mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=3DlayerB:layerA overlay mntAB
 mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=3DmntAB/layer2:mntAB/layer1 overlay mnt12

However, if you try this, you'll notice that It doesn't work, due to a
missing "overlay.whiteouts" xattr on mntAB/layer2/dir.
This is caused by the file that got added to layer2/dir in layerB.
Since we got a new merged directory (layerB/layer2/dir) it overrides
the escaped xattrs from layerA/layer2/dir.

This is not an absolute showstopper, but it would be a nice property
if escaping a layer was an isolated operation independent of the other
layers.

Nod.

Hopefully I explained it above, so we can come up with a solution.
