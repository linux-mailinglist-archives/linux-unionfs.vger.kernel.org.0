True. But if index is disabled, setting origin is moot. origin is only
ever used here to lookup the index.

About "origin" xattr. If it is not set in upper that lower fs probably does
not have file handle support. In that case, index cannot be enabled
anyway.

I agree with your analysis, but this is a very theoretical discussion.
Unless I am missing something, I think we have written a very complex
condition for a corner case that doesn't seem to be valid or interesting.

Basically, for non-dir, if there is no "origin" xattr, then there should be no
index, because the metacopy feature was added way long after we
started storing "origin" on copy up. That's not the case for directories.

There is one corner case where it may be relevant -
overlay layers with metacopy that were created on fs with no file handle
support (or no uuid) that are migrated to a filesystem with file handle
support (and metacopy xattr are preserved in migration).
In that case, index may be enabled while upper metacopy exists
without "origin".

What happens if we do not set origin and do not lookup index in that case?
We can get two overlay inodes, both from different metacopy upper inodes
redirected to the same lower inode, that have the same st_ino, but differnt
metadata.

I suppose we should have a protection in place for not making broken
upper hardlinks that are metacopy, but I don't see it...

No. it's fine. My eyes missed the ctr condition.
I still think since you are changing this code.
It will be much easier to follow if both simple continue statement
are at the top of the loop.

Thanks,
Amir.
