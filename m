> If there is an overlay mount that one of its lower layers contains a file with capabilities and in case that the lower layer is a nosuid mount (which means the file capabilities are being ignored at execution), an attacker with low-privileges user can touch the file, which causes the overlayFS driver to copy_up the file with its capabilities into the upper layer. That way the attacker can now execute the file with the file's capabilities, thus escalating its privileges.

I think this is a misunderstanding about how overlayfs operates.  Mounting
overlayfs is effectively a just-in-time version of "cp -a lowerdir upperdir".
In other words if the admin creates an overlay where the lower layer is
untrusted and the upper layer is trusted, then that act itself is the
privilege escalation.

This is more formally documented in "Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.rst"
in the "Permission model" section.

If this model is not clear, then maybe it needs to be spelled out more
explicitly.  Perhaps even a warning message could be added to the kernel logs
in case the lower mount is "nosuid".  But IMO erroring out on the copy-up or
skipping copy up of certain attributes would make the cure worse than the
disease.

Let me know if I'm missing something.

Thanks,
Miklos
