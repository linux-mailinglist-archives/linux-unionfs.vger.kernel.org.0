That is not what I meant by "output only"
I meant invalid input options as in EINVAL not ENOENT

Right, and we need to provide regular user needs in parallel to
providing C/R needs. understood.

Overlayfs mounts are internal not children mounts in the namespace,
so no open files hold reference the mounts in the namespace (AFAICS).

This use case will break:

  mount /dev/vdf /vdf
  mkdir /vdf/{l,u,w} /tmp/m
  mount -t overlay overlay /tmp/m -o
lowerdir=/vdf/l,upperdir=/vdf/u,workdir=/vdf/w
  umount /vdf

Yes users can lazy unmount, the filesystem itself on /dev/vdf is not actually
unmounted, only the /vdf mount goes away from the namespace, but the use case
without lazy unmount will still break.

Maybe its fine since distro/admin needs to opt-in for this change of behavior.
I have to wonder though, why did you add two different config/module
options for this feature? Yes, its two different sub-functionalities, but
which real user (not imaginary one) will really turn on just half the feature?
While at it, you copy pasted the text:
          For more information, see Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt
but there is no more information to be found.

Understood. but how do you *know* which mounts the container
created and need to be migrated?
Which loop devices the user has created?
As opposed to the ones that docker engine re-created?
It is the found from diff between mountinfo of process and host?

I see, so what about inotify/fanotify?
fhandle and uuid can be looked up/resolved to mnt/path at "dump" time.
The difference between mnt_id/uuid is who keeps the reference on the
mount. If overlayfs provides uuid, then you rely on docker to keep the
reference on the mount and use the reference-less uuid to find the
mount that docker is holding for you.

Let's stick to your use cases requirements. If you have other use cases
for this functionality lay them out explicitly.

I went to see what losetup does and I see that LOOP_SET_STATUS
ioctl stores a path string that LOOP_GET_STATUS gets back in return.
Does not seem C/R friendly either. Are you not handling loop devices?

It's strange because loop driver keeps an open backing file so
LOOP_GET_STATUS could have returned the uptodate path.

Thanks,
Amir.
