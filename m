That is a reasonable request.  I discussed a bit with Ted about how to
not set dentry functions filesystem wide,  because that gets in the way
of fscrypt.  I don't have a definite answer on how to do it, but it is
something that I will try to fix to enable fscrypt+casefold support.

Not yet, and that is part of the reason. Right now, these two features
cannot be enable simultaneously, but it is on my todo list to support
that case.
