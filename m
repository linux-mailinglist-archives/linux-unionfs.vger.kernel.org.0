I agree. I was curious that the above mentioned commit specifically
changed it from "upper" to "temp". While we could have used "upper" as
well.

Sure.

ohk.

Sure, agreed.

Sure. So here is what I was planning.
I am about to start going over patches mentioned in Amir's ovl-aops-wip
branch. My first preference would be to port it to latest upstream and
start cleaning it up.
I will update the branch details once those patches are ported to
latest upstream. Let me know if we should do this in any different way.

I will also be joining this year's plumber, in case if we want
to discuss anything on this. Although I am not sure if by then, I would
be able to get any substantial work done to discuss with a wider
audience. But nevertheless, we can always have a call/email exchanges
for this, both before and after the conference :)

That's really nice!!
