It is better to add "\:" if we want to be super nice and abide by the unspo=
ken
rule that the mount options parsed by libmount can be fed into mount(2) sys=
call
or back into libmount to get the same overlayfs config.

But I don't think it is a must because this rule is for overlayfs created w=
ith
mount(2) syscall or libmount, which knows how to split commas and use new
mount api, but it doesn't know how to split lowerdir colons.

If in the future, libmount will learn how to split lowerdir colons and use =
new
mount api to configure them one by one, then in the same future, libmount
will be able to distinguish between single escaped colons (\072) and
unescaped colons, and we do not need to add "\:" for making this possible.

It is not only historical.
In the present, even with most recent libmount, the mount(8) tool
e.g. mount -t overlay, displays the options (... upperdir=3Dx\,y) and
then the user can replay those options.

It is true that libmount could have displayed "upperdir=3Dx\054y" as
(... upperdir=3D"x,y"), which is the escaping for commas that libmount
supports, but:
1. libmount does not do that
2. those options could be fed back into libmount but not directly to
    mount(2)

See counter arguments.
My goal is to get as much of the parsing/escaping logic done by libmount
going forward, so I'd rather not add new escaping logic to new use cases
if we can avoid it.

At the moment, I would like to get some minimal fix to the 6.5 regression
merged while 6.5.y is still getting fixes.

If we cannot reach consensus within this short timeframe, then I think
that the smallest and least controversial fix is to escape colons once
as \072 as the current patch does.

We can always remove this escaping later if we find that it is not needed
no harm done. If you like, I can remove the commitment to mountinfo
format from documentation for the fix patch?

Being extra nice and displaying "a\,b" and "a\:b" for new users that
used new mount api explicitly to pass "a,b" and "a:b" is possible, but
it is not a 6.5 regression fix, so we can take the time to decide if we
want to do that or not.

OK?

Thanks,
Amir.
