No, I think copying layers is a different issue: it's not possible to
get the same file handle for A and B since they are

 - either on different filesystems and uuid is different
 - on the same filesystem, hence fh must be unique for the lifetime of the fs

We could add some sort of "overlay version"  to origin to be able to
trust null uuid, but only if created in *this* instance of overlayfs.
That way we retain some of the advantages without any of the
drawbacks.   This does not seem too complex theoretically, but not
sure if it's worth it.

Maybe, if 1) is problematic for some reason.
