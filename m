FYI, I have been playing with kmxz's overlay (offline tools).
It's a nice little tool :)
Adding "awareness" to redirect and metacopy was easy [1].

It should be easy to add support for command "export"
that does what Miklos suggested in order to migrate an image with
metacopy/redirect.

As a first step, command "vacuum" (or a new one) could be run
on layers to check if layers are already portable and then the
heavy weight "export" is not needed.

I submitted a talk proposal to plumbers containers track about
enabling overlayfs features in container runtimes [2].

The last time I brought up this topic [3] the discussion quickly shifted
to the hot shiftfs (pun intended) and the same thing happened with this
thread about offline tools [4].
Please resist the temptation to do that again!
I realize shiftfs and userns overlay are high priority features for containers.
I trust they will gets their own talk on containers track.

Vivek,

It would be great if you could co-author this talk with me, although
it is intended to be more of a round table discussion anyway.
The main idea is to exchange knowledge between overlayfs users
and overlayfs developers.

Thanks,
Amir.
