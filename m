Very good summary.
You may add:

But see one improvement below.
Also, please make sure to run unionmount setups:

./run --ov=10 --verify
./run --ov=10 --meta --verify

--verify will enable index and check st_dev;st_ino are not broken
on copy up. --ov=10 will cause lower hardlink copy up, because
after hardlink is creates by some test, upper is rotated to mid layer
and next modifying operation will trigger the hardlink copy up.

No need to understand the long story to verify this change is correct.
This is true simply because the conditions to set stack = origin_path are:

       if (!metacopy && !d.is_dir && upperdentry && !ctr && origin_path)

And after getting there and setting ctr = 1, the complex conditions to
setting origin are met for certain:

        if (ctr && (!upperdentry || (!d.is_dir && !metacopy)))

Therefore, it is logically equivalent (and makes much more sense)
to assign origin near stack = origin_path.

Further, thanks to Vivek's explanation, it is now clear to me that after
setting origin above, all that is left to do here is:

         /* Always lookup index of non-upper */
        if (!upperdentry)
                origin = stack[0].dentry;

All the upperdentry cases described in the commit message have already
been dealt with by the time we get here.

Thanks,
Amir.
