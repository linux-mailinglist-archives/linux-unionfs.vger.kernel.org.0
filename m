I think I had not implemented metacopy with nfs export because it seemed
non-trivial and I did not need nfs export feature support with metacopy.
So I decided to narrow down the problem space and not support nfs
export and metacopy together.

It will be good if somebody can dive deeper and make it work (if it
is possible to make it work).
