Hi Kevin,

Thanks for following up on this.
I see my original comment did not make it to the list, because the message
was formatted incorrectly.

My full comment was:

"...
My feeling is that we need to adjust the fix and not treat the case
of xino=auto as "user opted-in for xino" thus disabling origin inode
decode for lower without uuid.

Also the documentation does not mention the xino feature as one
of the "forbidden" features for this use case.
..."

So your Documentation fix may represent the current code, but
I think we should fix the code instead.

When looking again, I actually don't see a reason to include "xino"
in this check at all (not xino=on nor xino=auto):

 if (!ofs->config.index && !ofs->config.metacopy && !ofs->config.xino &&
     uuid_is_null(uuid))
         return false;

The reason that "index" and "metacopy" are in this check is because
they *need* to follow the lower inode of a non-dir upper in order to
operate correctly. The same is not true for "xino".

Moreover, "xino" will happily be enabled also when lower fs does not
support file handles at all. It will operate sub-optimally, but it will live up
to the promise to provide a unified inode namespace and uniform st_dev.

Note that "redirect_dir" is not one of the "forbidden" features.

Thanks,
Amir.
