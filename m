Yeah, I'm doing what they're doing but making the EROFS in-house and
hoping the kinda-writable NFS twist isn't an issue. I only need to
satisfy dependencies for a container's worth of software at a time and I
can determine all the dependencies I need by virtue of tooling in the
software ecosystems I need to support.

Yeah I understand your objective now. I'm mildly curious why NFS +
fscache doesn't solve the negative lookups case for you given that you
want a dynamically generated local cache. Is fscache just unable to
cache negative lookups, and you want it to persist for weeks?

Also (only semi-related) since you have a large NFS deployment similar
to the one I'm putting together in terms of read-only to normal clients
and most files/paths being immutable after they first appear, I'd be
interested in any experiences you've had in practice with performance of
fscache and NFS mount options that relax its cache coherence / atomicity
semantics. I've found it impossible to avoid roundtrips to the server on
each fopen for locally cached files (unless using NFS4 delegation which
is overkill and not available in my environment.) These RPC roundtrips
provide no real benefit to our use case but can add seconds of delay to
initializing a process if it accesses thousands of little interpreted
language files.

Not an overlayfs concern in any way though so perhaps no need to pollute
the mailing list further; if you are interested in responding to me on
these things continuing off list would be fine with me too.

I dunno, your thing might end up working out fine, based on your latest
testing of when clients see changes and Amir's observation that all fds
need to be closed but then a readdir through an overlayfs will observe
changes. Seems "unlikely" that clients would hold open fds to the first
few levels of directories at all, never mind for long enough for someone
to call you and ask where the new version is :)
