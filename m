Maybe.
Failure of overlay/075 on master is known.
Failure of overlay/065 on master was fixed by xfstests commit
* 6159ae7f - overlay/065: Adapt test to relaxed rules
so you may want to update your xfstests copy.

Failure of overlay/005 is not familiar to me and the
attached log is missing all the output of the test -
it just has the summary.

Worst yet, according to summary, all those test do not run in your setup:
Not run: overlay/001 overlay/004 overlay/008 overlay/015 overlay/020
overlay/021 overlay/025 overlay/032 overlay/045 overlay/046
overlay/056 overlay/064 overlay/100 overlay/101 overlay/102
overlay/103 overlay/104 overlay/105 overlay/106 overlay/107
overlay/108 overlay/109 overlay/110 overlay/111 overlay/112
overlay/113 overlay/114 overlay/115 overlay/116 overlay/117

Can you provide the full log to understand the reason or figure it out yourself
and fix this.
If you are running a special setup that is fine, it doesn't have to
run all the test
(as long as you know why), but in order to verify that your patches did not
break other setups, you need to test with a common setup where all the
above tests run and pass, short of overlay/075 which is a known upstream issue.

I'm a bit surprised that tests overlay/068 overlay/069 did not fail with v2
Maybe they did not run and you did not notice that in the report?

Miklos would have to answer this question.
It shouldn't take long if he agrees with the patch.

Thanks,
Amir.
