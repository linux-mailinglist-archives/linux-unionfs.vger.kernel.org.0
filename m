POSIX does allow stale readdir data (not just in case of non-zero seek):

"If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the most
recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(), whether a subsequent call to
readdir() returns an entry for that file is unspecified."

If you think about the way readdir(3) is implemented by the libc, this
is inevitable.

Returning ENOENT from readdir(3) is obviously a bug.

The merge case being not super high performance is perfectly okay.
The only thing I've worried about in that case is unbound memory use,
but apparently that hasn't been an issue in practice.

Thanks,
Miklos
