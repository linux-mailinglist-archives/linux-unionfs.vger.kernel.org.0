After I was unable to reproduce EIO by accessing the file on upper
directly and had no error message, I started grepping for EIO in
overlayfs, which led to multiple results and no clear next step (kernel
tracing helped, but was still difficult to isolate the source of EIO).
Having any error message would get me to the point in the code where the
error was encountered.  Mentioning metacopy gets me to a causal feature,
which would have been helpful for understanding.

Sure.  That wording sounds better to me.  I'll send an updated patch
shortly.

Thanks,
