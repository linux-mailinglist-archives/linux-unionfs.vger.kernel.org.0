So what's the end goal. We don't want to return error during lookup,
if underlying layer changed and instead force re-lookup. And re-lookup
might work in a slightly different way and that's allowed?

IOW, we don't want to return error if we detected lower layer change
and just continue to run. It might fail later or it might subtly
change behavior in some way (inode number reporting etc). But that's
fine?

What will documentation says. Lower layer changes are allowed? Or
we say lower layer changes are not allowed but overlay will not
flag it at runtime even if we detect it.

Thanks
Vivek
