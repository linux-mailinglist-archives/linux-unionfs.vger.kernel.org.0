IIUC, idea was that automated mounting can mount a handcrafted upper on
usb hence allow access to directories on host which are otherwise
inaccessible.

Even if it is paranoia, put more unrelated checks under this option does
not make much sense to me. It will make things just more confusing.

Anyway, redirect_dir=nofollow is a thing of past. Now if you want to
not follow origin, then we first need to have a genuine explanation
of why to do that (and not be driven by just paranoia).

redirect_dir=nofollow resulting in origin not being followed is plain
unintuitive to me. Why not introduce another option if not following
origin is so important.
