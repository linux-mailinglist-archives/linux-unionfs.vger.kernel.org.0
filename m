Correct.

We do not change our statement:
"Changes to the underlying filesystems while part of a mounted overlay
filesystem are not allowed.  If the underlying filesystem is changed,
the behavior of the overlay is undefined, though it will not result in
a crash or deadlock."

Only we are slightly more credible when saying won't result in
crash or deadlock...

Note that we can perform similar validations before certain operations,
for example, validate parent stack before performing ovl_lookup()
to further fortify the code against xxxat(dfd, ...) syscalls.

Another operation that works on an fd with dentry that may have lowerstack
that might be relevant is ovl_iterate(), but I wouldn't go dealing with them
one by one without a plan.

The reason I posted those RFC patches is because I wrote them anyway
for my snapshot series, so though they might be of interest.

Thanks,
Amir.
