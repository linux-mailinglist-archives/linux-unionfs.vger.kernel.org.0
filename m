I think if you make the prefix (the /.cfs part) "weird" enough it will
only become an issue for the malicious layer case. For example, a
malicious layer could inject a file that was typically unused, but if
an upper layer happened to use a particular redirect path it would get
unexpected content for its redirect.

However, you wouldn't be able to inject such a base layer after the
fact, it would have to have been there already in the base layer used
when building the upper layer. So in this case I agree, such a
malicious layer used already at image build time can do malicious
things in much easier ways anyway.

I can't think of any use of this currently. Generally we very rarely
work with images using a backing store tied to a particular machine
like this. Generally the goal is to have something you can distribute.
