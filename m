See one suggestion below, but you may ignore it...

Technically, you are calling this right after creating OVL_WORKDIR_NAME, so you
could start from ofs->workdir and drop the first level, but as you wrote it this
function could also be called also after the assignment ovl->workdir =
ovl->indexdir
so it is probably safer to start with ofs->workbasedir as you did.

I think a helper ovl_test_create() along the lines of the helper found on
my ovl-features branch could make this code a lot easier to follow.
Note that the helper in that branch in not ready to be cherry-picked
as is - it needs changes, so take it or leave it.

Thanks,
Amir.
