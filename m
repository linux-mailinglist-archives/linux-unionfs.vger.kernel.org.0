Ok, I am wondering why are we concerned about older kernels. I mean,
if we introduce new features, we don't provide compatibility with
older kernels. Say "metacopy", "redirect_dir". If you mount with
older kernel, they will see something which you don't expect.

So why "volatile" is different. We seem to be bending backward and
using an unrelated behavior of overlay to provide this.

Why not simply drop a file $workdir/volatile for volatile mounts
and check for presence of this file when mounting?

Thanks
