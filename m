All right. But you do not have to rely on xino && !ovl_same_fs().
What you need is for ovl_calc_d_ino() to be true.

For example, consider this (edited) condition in ovl_calc_d_ino():
        /*
         * Recalc d_ino for all entries if dir is impure (contains
         * copied up entries)
         */
        if (ovl_test_flag(OVL_IMPURE, d_inode(rdd->dentry)))
                return true;

It decided to lookup the entries based on a property of the parent dir.

Specifically, this check will always be true for merge dirs that have an
upper dir with non-zero copied-up files.
But you can use the some principle to "taint" directories that contain
"xattr_whiteouts" in a similar manner to "impurity" and that would
be enough for ovl_calc_d_ino() to do the right thing also for merge dirs
with no upper dir.

If we do this, then both overlay.whiteout and overlay.xattr_whiteouts
xattrs will be xattrs that the overlayfs driver never sets.
It's a precedent, but as long as it is properly documented and encoded
in fstests, I will be fine with it. Not sure about Miklos.

Are you ok with leaving the responsibility to mark the directories as
overlay.xattr_whiteouts to mkfs.composefs?
Does this solution work for you?

Thanks,
Amir.
