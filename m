I don't really get it.  What's the advantage of not having an object?

Readdir returning DT_WHT internally might be nice, but I'd be careful
with exporting that to userspace, since it's likely to cause more
problems that it solves.   And on the stat(2) interface adding S_IFWHT
or even worse: ENOENT are really out of the question due to backward
incompatibility with almost every application.

Right.

Can't mkfs.ext4 just create the static object?  That sounds to me like
the simplest approach.

Thanks,
