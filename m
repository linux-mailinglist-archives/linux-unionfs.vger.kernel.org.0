Dunno.

I feel that instead of making the behavior defined when file is
modified behind fuse's back, there should be some mechanism between
the server and the client (userspace and kernel) that allows proper
handling of "remote" modification (oplocks/leases/younameit).

I thought about this quite a bit, and even have some patches for the
read-only lease case.  But this is far from trivial.

In the meantime just setting IOCB_APPEND is quite harmless, so I think
we should do it for both overlayfs and fuse for consistency.

Looks good.

Great.  Thanks.
