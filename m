Hi Amir,

I am not able to understand this point. Why an extra mount option
needs to be translated into a "test config" option. If I pass
"metacopy=on", that does not mean that I also want to run tests
which verify st_blocks == 0 on upper. It just means that whatever
tests I am running, are run with metacopy=on. All I want to make
sure that tests I am running are not broken if run with metacopy=on.

Thanks
Vivek
