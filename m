I haven't done any tracing, perhaps I overstated.  The problem I'm
seeing only happens when overlayfs goes to create a copy of a lower
layer file in the upper layer.  When the problem occurs, it's always
on a file that exists on lower but not upper, and is about to be
modified.

I'm having a hard time reproducing the problem.  It's only happening
frequently enough for me to be pretty sure it's a bug.  I've been
using an overlay of squashfs/EXT4 on my development laptop for over a
year, using the squashfs image to fork off disposable virtual machines
for testing.  It's worked flawlessly up until I started testing w/
5.9... but I couldn't correlate my problems to anything specific until
just recently.

More than once now, my host system or a virtual machine has randomly
failed to process an apt update.  Either a backup hardlink creation
fails or some other processing command fails, always with an error
message of "No data available", which makes no sense to me.  Booting
back into my 5.4 or 5.8 kernel and performing the upgrade, then back
into my 5.9 kernel alleviates the problem until it happens again on
some other package.

I have also seen "No data available" pop up in seemingly random
places.  For example, yesterday postfix refused to send mail, and when
I went to restart the service I got this:

postfix/bounce[24836]: fatal: open lock file pid/unix.bounce: cannot
open file: No data available

Today, in 5.9.14, I did an apt upgrade which didn't fail creating
backup files, but instead failed doing a postinstall task like this:

Setting up sudo (1.8.21p2-3ubuntu1.3) ...
chown: changing ownership of '/etc/sudoers': No data available
dpkg: error processing package sudo (--configure):
 installed sudo package post-installation script subprocess returned
error exit status 1

Rebooting the vm resulted in the same problem.  Booting into 5.8.18,
apt upgrade succeeded.  Then I rebooted back into 5.9.

Trying that shortly.  Also trying to figure out how to force the
problem to happen...  I'll never get to the bottom of it at this rate.
I was really hoping somebody on the list would recognize the
problem...  :-/  Just my luck.
