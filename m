I don't believe we need the sync=shutdown.  But I am fine with adding it.

in both cases we are looking at using this.  Buildah for building
container images

and CRI-O where Kubernetes comes in and blows away all of the containers
on system

restart, we don't care about data in the upper directory on a crash.
