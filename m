If you're confident that this series will land in v6.4, then sure, you can apply
my patch "fsverity: rework fsverity_get_digest() again" to overlayfs-next,
instead of me taking it through fsverity/for-next.  (Hopefully the IMA
maintainer will ack it as well, as it touches security/integrity/.)

Just be careful about being overly-optimistic about features landing in the next
release.  I've had experience with cases like this before, where I didn't apply
something for a reason like this, but then the series didn't make it in right
away so it was worse than me just taking the patch in the first place.

I do see that the other prerequisites were just applied to overlayfs-next, so
maybe this is good to go now.  It's up to the other overlayfs folks.
