What you can do is use the new mount API for kernel >=3D6.5
and provide the parameters one by one, e.g.:

fsconfig(fs_fd, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "lowerdir", "/tmp/test-lower,", 0);

See example in commit message of
b36a5780cb44 ("ovl: modify layer parameter parsing")

The mount tool and libmount in util-linux 2.39 support the new mount API [1=
].
They already auto detect and fallback to the old mount API, so you wouldn't
need to implement per kernel version logic.

I do not know if the new mount tool would split this string on the escaped =
\,

-o 'lowerdir=3D/tmp/test-lower\,,upperdir=3D/tmp/test-upper,workdir=3D/tmp/=
test-work'

But the kernel old mount(2) syscall does NOT escape the , when splitting
the options string into parameters.

ovl used to do it with the old mount API:
91c77947133f ("ovl: allow filenames with comma")

But it does not do that after the conversion to the new mount API,
where generic_parse_monolithic() is used for splitting the parameters.
I prefer not to have to override ->parse_monolithic() for this behavior
if it works as desired for you when using new libmount.

Thanks,
Amir.
