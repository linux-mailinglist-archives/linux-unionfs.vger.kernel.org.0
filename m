I am perfectly fine with saying that
and with allowing the special case of cloning disk with index=nouuid.

There was a "patch" floating around for improving the doc,
I was assuming you will pick it up add your own proposed changes
and make it into a proper patch.

No, it does not. I am only saying index=nouuid is "just" as bad
as what people can already do with virtiofs. Not much worse.

Only rational is - it is intended for cloned disk - don't make it easy
to use this for
anything else.
