Hi Yuriy,

This version has some inaccuracies and some irrelevant
information IMO. I will try to point them out.
Please be aware that this is an overview/design document
and it is not the intention to commit to the implementation details
of overlayfs.

I cannot put my finger on it, I just don't like this rephrasing and it serv=
es no
good purpose IMO. mv(1) is not an operation, it is a tool, so the phrasing
is just inaccurate.

Again I do not like this phrasing. It suggests that there is a copy up
operation that copies entire directory content and that is not true.
chown of directory will copy up directory without content and that
has nothing to do with redirect_dir.

"simply renamed" is not a clear technical description.
Not changing a parent is what you want to say, but TBH, I just don't
think that we want to commit to this implementation detail and I am
really not sure why putting it in the document is helpful.

I dislike the use of these invented variable names that were not
defined earlier in the doc, please don't use that notation.

Not something that we want or can commit to.
Some filesystems count xattr blocks in du (depending on size of
all the xattr) so it is not possible to commit to this statement and
I do not think that it adds much to the document.

Again, not related to redirect_dir.
This is a description of how copy up generally works in overlayfs.
If you think that this information is missing from the document,
please try to add it to the Directories section.

I am sorry, I do not like this phrasing, but also cannot offer something be=
tter
because I am not sure what missing information you are trying to add.

The only thing I would change in the doc is replace
"Full file will be copied up later..."
with
"File data will be copied up later..."

No invented env variables please. we cannot commit to zero du.

Maybe just add here at the end:

An upper file in this state is marked with "trusted.overlayfs.metacopy" xat=
tr
which indicates that the upper file contains no data.
After the lower file's data is copied up, the "trusted.overlayfs.metacopy" =
xattr
is removed from the upper file.

Thanks,
Amir.
