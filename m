Hi,

I noticed that you can still unmount the lower/upper/work layers, even if
they're currently part of an active overlay mount. This is the case even when
files in the overlay mount are currently open. After unmounting, the usual
effects of a lazy umount can be observed, like still active loop devices.

Is this intentional? From a quick look, for open files this might be a side
effect of using open_with_fake_path, but just getting a reference to the paths
in ovl_mount_dir and preventing unmounting for the duration of the overlay
mount would cover that as well AFAICT.

Thanks,
Fabian
