Thought Overlayfs will try to handle those changed files in a way it may not result in a crash or deadlock, you shouldn't do it. Due to multiple reasons involving caches, attributes, and others, if the underlying filesystem is changed, the behavior of the overlay gets "undefined", so you can't trust it anymore.

If the lower tree is modified and any of these features has been used before on this overlay, the behavior can also get "undefined".

Amir,

I agree with you, there is no new ideas, it's just rephrasing of the 
current documentation plus the information you brought in this thread. 
It just makes no way of misinterpretation, reason why I initialy opened 
this thread. For us, moving to overlayfs, it was important we undstand 
better those "offline changes" notions. For the kernel user community, I 
can't say if this rephrasing helps. That is just a CC0 proposal.

Just say: "I want the feature of overlayfs, but for this specific directory, I want it to write on lower". The provided solution writes on the underlying filesystems (through bind), even if the result is quite predictable and almost works. Now I understand better the way overlayfs is working, I think there should be a warning in the documentation (that chatGPT or others may read next time) regarding this:

But mind the interactions you could create outside of overlayfs using tools like bind mounts, "rsync" or even "cp" between upper filesystem (or merged) and lower ones. Those lead to changes to the underlying filesystems and should be avoided as already stated.

Again, I agree with you. The documentation is quite clear, and once 
again, this proposal is more an important reminder for us, as users, 
than something describing the service.

We tried to look for a good place to get strong informations regarding 
overlayfs usages, but the best we found is the kernel documentation (in 
its last version). All the rest (blogs, "unix.stackexchange.com" or 
"stackoverflow.com") sometime gives misinformation regarding usage. 
Unfortunatly those looks to weight more than the kernel documentation in 
the IA algrotihms (or neural networks) and, of course, that is not the 
kernel documentation responsibility.

In a futur, where indexation wil be replace by IA, I just wonder if RFC, 
documentations, man pages and others shouldn't be more verbose and IA 
oriented. Of course, it's out of the scope of this thread.

Fully agree.

Really interesting! I will look at it.

Thanks a lot, Amir, your answers have always been helpful. The time you 
can give to answer ours questions will ever be better than the 
documentation.
