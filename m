He, that's not what I meant.
I wouldn't expect that you *observe* any issues, because the issues
with following the wrong object are quite rare and you need to make
changes to lower squashfs to notice them, see:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191106234301.283006-1-colin.king@canonical.com/

But as a matter of fact, I was wrong and I misled you. Sorry.

I read the code backwards.

It's not true that we can allow lower modification with "xino=on/auto" -
quite the opposite - we may need to disallow lower modifications also
with "xino=off".

Let me explain.
The following table documents expected behavior with different
features and layer setups:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html#inode-properties

As you can see, the matrix is quite complex.
The problem lies with the documented behavior of "Persistent st_ino of !dir"
for the case of "Layers not on same fs, xino=off".

It claims that st_ino will be persistent, but in fact it is only true
if lower fs
supports file handles AND has a unique [*] UUID amongst the lower layers.
The claim that st_ino is persistent for !dir in case of "ino overflow" is also
incorrect.

[*] The special case of NULL UUID (e.g. squashfs) was recently changed
     and depends on whether the opt-in features are enabled...

In any case, the documented behavior for Persistent st_ino (!dir) is
incorrect for the case of (e.g.) lower squashfs with -no-exports.
IWO, in this setup, st_ino of a lower file will change following copy up
and mount cycle.

I do not want to add all this story to documentation - the matrix is
complex enough to follow as it is.

Seeing that distros are switching to enable xino by default, I was
contemplating to change the behavior of the code as follows:

- If user opts-out of xino by mount option (xino=off is *shown*
  in /proc/mounts) do not follow origin by file handle
- Let index and metacopy require and auto-enable xino, so e.g.:
  mount options index=on,xino=off will be a conflict
- If lower does not support file handles or has NULL UUID and
  xino is enabled by default, then auto-disable xino and do not
  follow origin (xino=off will be shown in /proc/mounts)
- If xino is disabled by default, we DO follow origin as we always
  did (xino=off is NOT shown in /proc/mounts)
- Change the documented value for Persistent st_ino (!dir) in case
  of "xino=off" and in case of "ino overflow" to N

Pros:
1. This makes for simpler and more coherent documentation IMO.
2. It doesn't change behavior for legacy layers with all default
    kernel configs and default mount options.
3. It actively averts the reported issues caused by re-formatting
    lower squashfs with distro kernel configs and default mount options.

Cons:
1. After kernel upgrade, existing setups with lower squashfs that did
    not opt-in for xino by mount option will lose xino
2. Existing setups that opt-out of xino by mount option (because of old
    32bit applications?) will loose persistent st_ino behavior

IMO, the Pros out weight the Cons.

I've suggested adding a way to opt-out of following origin several times,
but was not able to convince Miklos so far.
Let's see if this time is any different...

I just mislead you. Sorry for that.
We should leave "redirect_dir" in the documented list and add "xino"
just like the patch you posted.
But I guess if I am going to post a patch to change the xino behavior,
it would be better to include your change in my patch for context.

Thanks,
Amir.
