The current implementation is quite simplified due to keeping data-only
layers in the tail, and even more simplified that lazy lowerdata lookup
is only in the data-only layers at the tail of the stack.
The documentation is also simpler as do the tests.

Making all the the above more complex needs justification and so far
I did not see any use case that would justify it, because the /.cfs
workaround is good enough IMO.

That leaves the question - is the design/API flexible enough to be
extended in the future if we needed to?

If we would want to support data-only layers in the middle on the
stack, which would this syntax make sense?
lowerdir=3Dlower1::data1:lower2::data2

If this syntax makes sense to everyone, then we can change the syntax
of data-only in the tail from lower1::data1:data2 to lower1::data1::data2
and enforce that after the first ::, only :: are allowed.

Miklos, any thoughts?
I have a feeling that this was your natural interpretation when you first
saw the :: syntax.

Thanks,
Amir.
