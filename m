This came out too complicated. Let me try again -

The documentation in the section:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html#overlay-objects
speaks about overlayfs objects having non-unique and non-persistent st_ino.
It then goes on to say that "xino" can be used to make overlayfs "compliant",
but in fact never speaks of persistent st_ino until the comparison table,
where the documented values are incorrect.

So I decided to try and promote "xino" from a feature that "makes inode
numbers unique" to a feature that "makes inode numbers unique and
if possible, also persistent" by adding the following text to the section:

"...
The "xino" feature can be enabled with the "-o xino=on" overlay mount option.
If all underlying filesystems support NFS file handles, the value of st_ino
for overlay filesystem objects is not only unique, but also persistent over
the lifetime of the filesystem.  The "-o xino=auto" overlay mount option
enables the "xino" feature only if the persistent st_ino requirement is met.
..."

And with this I pured new meaning into xino=auto, which lost its original
meaning after commit:
926e94d79baf ("ovl: enable xino automatically in more cases")

The code change is to fall back from xino=auto to xino=off in cases
where the lower layer has no file handle support or bad uuid.

I'll post the patch for review soon.

Thanks,
Amir.
