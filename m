Immutability of underlying files was not my concern.
My concern was that vfs does not provide full protection and that some
protection is provided in fs level, because I saw IS_APPEND/IS_IMMUTABLE
sprinkled all over the place in fs (e.g. ext4_setattr()), but I guess those are
just leftovers and I was over concerned.

I suppose so. Note that #3 fileattr_get is still a merge between upper fileattr
and the 4 overlay stored flags, but for inode flags it will not be a merge.

I can give this a shot.

While you are here, do you think that will be sufficient for the on-disk format
of overlay.xflags?

struct ovl_xflags {
        __le32 xflags;
        __le32 xflags_mask;
}

Thanks,
Amir.
