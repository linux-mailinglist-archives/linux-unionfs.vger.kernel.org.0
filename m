That would do it.  So the tests were in fact skipping themselves as expected;
just the skip message was not clear.

I'm thinking it wouldn't be worth bothering, as the --block-size option was in
the first actual release of fsverity-utils (v1.0).  You must have pulled down a
work-in-progress version of fsverity-utils back in 2018 or early 2019, well
before the kernel support for fsverity was upstreamed, and then never updated
it.  I expect this issue affects very few people.

It was already updated several months ago.  Please run 'git pull'.

xfstests has a verity test *group*, which contains the tests that were written
specifically to test verity.

An xfstests-bld test config is something that applies to all tests.  Features
like "encrypt" have an xfstests-bld test config since there is a way to
enable/use those features in all tests.  In the case of encrypt that means
mounting the filesystem with "-o test_dummy_encryption".

In the case of verity, there is no way to enable/use verity in all tests.  (It
would be possible to always enable "-O verity" on the filesystem, but that does
nothing to make verity actually be used/tested.)  Hence, it doesn't have an
xfstests-bld test config.

> Are you guys not testing fsverity with fstests-bld?

We are.  The documented way to test fsverity is to use kvm-xfstests:

As per the above, I don't think there is anything to fix.
