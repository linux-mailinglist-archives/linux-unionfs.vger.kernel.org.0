I reviewed v5 and it is all fine by me, but I do agree with Eric that
it has become quite late for 6.5 and other reviewers need to get
enough time to review v5, so no need to rush.

I also need some time to test verity feature which I hadn't had
the chance to do yet, so it looks like the stars are aligned for 6.6.
I am planning to be on vacation around 6.5-rc2..6.5-rc6 -
because of your efforts to get the patches ready in time for 6.5,
I will now have time to test your patches before -rc6, so your
efforts have not been in vain...

Thanks,
Amir.
