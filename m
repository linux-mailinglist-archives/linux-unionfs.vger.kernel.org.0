Thanks Christian. Went through idmappings.rst and that helps a lot
in understanding what's going on w.r.t id mappings.

Following are just some thoughts for my education.

I think "filesystem idmappings" are little tricky. IIUC, it is
for the case where unprivileged mounting of filesystem is allowd.
(FS_USERNS_MOUNT). And once filesystem allows that, that means if
uid in user_ns will show up on disk. So root inside user namespace
creates a file foo.txt, it should show up on disk as uid/gid 0/0.

Overlayfs does allow "FS_USERNS_MOUNT". I don't think it ever translates
them back to user space id using filesystem idmappings. It just passes kuid
down to underlying filesystem. And if underlying filesystem
does not support "FS_USERNS_MOUNT", then files created by
root inside userns, show up as owned some unpriviliged id
on host.

I guess overlayfs is little special in this sense because it does
not actually save files on disk and does not have to translate
kuid back to uid using filesystem idmappings.
