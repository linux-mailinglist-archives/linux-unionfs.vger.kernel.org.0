Got it.

So what's the side affect of this? I mean one even you make this change,
it is possible that on a cpu parallel unlink is going on and right
after d_revalidate() finishes, upper is marked negative (or directory
S_DEAD).

So this change will not plug the hole. It will just narrow it a bit?

/me is failing to see complete picture that what's the problem at
macro level and how this patch fixes it.

Thanks
