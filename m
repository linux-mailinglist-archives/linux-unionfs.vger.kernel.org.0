Ok, I will look into it.

When it comes to requirements, to me it felt that Giuseppe seemed
to have two requirements. For running containers, he did not care
seem to care about syncing upper to disk at all. For building
images he probably wanted to sync upper to disk.

From overlayfs perspective, "volatile,sync=shutdown" seems like
a nicer interface because overlay will take care of removing
"dirty" file and until and unless crash happens, user does
not have to step in and there is less confusion about syncing
upper and removing dirty file etc.

Last time Miklos seemed to prefer to implement just "volatile"
for now and drop "sync=shutdown".

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/CAJfpegt2k=r6TRok57tKPcLyUhCBOcBAV7bgLSPrQYXsPoPkpQ@mail.gmail.com/

I personally think that "volatile,sync=shutdown" is first good step
because it is less error prone and overlayfs manages dirty file
and it will provide lot of benefits in terms of not having to
do very frequent sync.

And if this does not prove to be enough for certain use cases,
then one can extend this to also implement "volatile,sync=none".

But frankly speaking, there has been so much of back and forth
on this patch, that I am fine with any of the option which is
acceptable to Miklos.
