Dropping a positive dentry is harmful in case there's a long term
reference to the dentry (e.g. an open file) since it will look as if
the file was deleted, when in fact it wasn't.

It's possible to unhash a negative dentry in a safe way if we make
sure it cannot become positive.  One way is to grab d_lock and remove
it from the hash table only if count is one.

So yes, we could have a helper to do that instead of the lookup flag.
The disadvantage being that we'd also be dropping negatives that did
not enter the cache because of our lookup.

I don't really care, both are probably good enough for the overlayfs case.

Thanks,
Miklos
