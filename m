An alternative way might allow data-only layers (or invisible layers) in the
middle rather than as the tail?

I'm not sure in the long term if it's flexible to fix data-only layers as the
bottom-most layers for future potential use cases.

At a quick glance, I've seen the implementation of this patchset also
strictly code that.   I wonder if using non-fixed invisible layers increases
the complexity or am I still missing something?

Thanks,
