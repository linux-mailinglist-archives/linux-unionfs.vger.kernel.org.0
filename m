If the modification of the file happens via the kernel vfs API, then
the new backing file will have either have no, or the wrong fs-verity
digest, which will be reported by overlayfs on open. It is true that a
modification on the block level which the vfs is unaware of will be
reported at read time, by fs-verity (i.e. independent of overlayfs).
This is what I meant by the "in addition .." part, but maybe that is
not clear. I'll try to rephrase it.
