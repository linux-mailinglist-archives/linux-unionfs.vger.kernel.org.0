Hey Vivek,

These are great questions. I'm happy to answer them.
Please feel free to also peruse the documentation in mnt_idmapping.h and
in Documentations/filesystems/idmappings.rst (the latter needs updating
though as the function names changed).

Usually all of that is done in the vfs. But since overlayfs calls
notify_change() directly on the upper layer this step needs to be done
here. So this is what ovl_do_notify_change() is doing.

As you might know notify_change() is (among other things) used to change
i_{g,u}id. For filesystems only mountable in init_user_ns the i_{g,u}id
values are identical to the on-disk or "backend store values".

I'll use the (slimmed down) systemd-homed example. Assume we have an xfs
filesystem mounted where all inodes on-disk are owned by 65534. We want
to use a part of this xfs filesystem as our home directory mounted as
/home/my-user. Our id on this system is 1000.

What systemd-homed will do is create an idmapped mount at /home/my-user.
The mapping it will use is: 65534:1000:<some-range>.

## Reporting file ownership
If we now access /home/my-user and call stat to look at the ownership we
see that all files are reported as being owned by id 1000.

The responsible higher-level function here is i_uid_into_mnt() which
translates from filesystem ownership into mount ownership. It uses the
lower-level mapped_k*id_fs() which maps any inode owned by 65534 on-disk
to 1000. Ultimately that's put in struct kstat and then reported in the
last step to the user.

## Creating new files
Now assume we're creating a new file in /home/my-user called "my-file".
We know our id is 1000. We know that the idmapped mount makes it so that
files on-disk owned by id 65534 are owned by id 1000.
When we create new files on disk we thus need to create them as 65534.
So if we do touch /home/my-dir/myfile followed by a stat on the file it
will be owned by id 1000.

The function responsible for this is inode_fs*id_set() and it translates
in the other direction, i.e. it maps from the idmapped mount into the
filesystem 1000 -> 65534. The low-level function that is responsible for
this is mapped_k*id_user() (as we're mapping from userspace to an on-disk
value).

## Changing ownership: notify_change()
Now assume we're trying to change ownership for some file on-disk in the
idmapped mount to make it writable for our caller. Again, the idmapped
mount makes it so that all files owned by id 65534 on-disk are owned by
id 1000 in the idmapped mount.
If a (sufficiently privileged over the inode ofc) calls:
chown 1000:1000 /home/my-dir/some-file
in the idmapped mount it's conceptually identical to creating a new file
on-disk. This we covered earlier. We need to translate from the idmapped
mount into the filesystem and thus from 1000 to 65534.
The iattr->ia_{g,u}id need to contain the value 65534 as that's the
ownership that needs to be on-disk. So here we call the
mapped_k*id_user() helper.

So if we do chown 1000:1000 /home/my-dir/some-file
followed by stat on the file it will be owned by id 1000.

If we look at the filesystem from a non-idmapped location all files
on-disk will be owned by 65534.

Correct. You can see this clearly in mnt_idmapping.h

The idmapped mount infra was designed to be generic enough so that it is
possible to create idmapped mounts for filesystems that are themselves
idmapped.

It is important to understand that only filesystem that set
FS_ALLOW_IDMAP in fs_flags are able to create idmapped mounts. Currently
no filesystem that is mountable with a non-initial idmapping raises that
flag. But if a filesystem wanted to do this then it is possible.

Hope this helps!
