Vivek, if you vendor the containers/storage branch into Podman you can run something like:

# podman run --uidmap 0:2000:40000 --gidmap 0:8000:50000 --rm fedora sh -c 'grep . /proc/self/?id_map; ls -l /'
/proc/self/gid_map:         0       8000      50000
/proc/self/uid_map:         0       2000      40000

you'll notice that it is using idmapped mounts because the container
starts immediately when you change the mappings; without these kernel
patches Podman needs to chown the image first.

Giuseppe
