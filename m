Seems to me that they should be copied up.
A copy up should not hide xattrs that are visible before copy up.

I must admit that I personally cannot follow all the user cases that we wan=
t
to cover and I think that the opaque example above demonstrates that there
is no one answer that fits all use cases.

Not sure what you are suggesting.
If you are suggesting to drop this patch and fix the
xattr escaping patch to copy up escaped xattr
then I completely agree.

Thanks,
