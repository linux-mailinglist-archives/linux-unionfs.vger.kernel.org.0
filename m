No. That's not what I mean by re-creating lower fs.
What I mean is that overlayfs is the file is question is in the squashfs
image and has been copied up.

I don't know where the squashfs image you are using comes from
but I am guessing you have replaced it with a new squashfs image.
In the new squashfs image, files have different inode numbers.

I reckon this behavior is common for OpenWRT where the system
image is being upgraded.

Well, that is the purpose of my patch -
When overlayfs reports the warning it will NOT prevent reading the
file, so it should NOT make the whole system unusable.

Thanks,
Amir.
