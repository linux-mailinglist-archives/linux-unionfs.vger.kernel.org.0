Ok. No need for hostility, I am just trying to figure out what would
be the best solution for everyone going forward.

How about an API that takes upperdirfd, workdirfd, lowerdirfd,
leaving string parsing and path resolution completely out of the equation?

I think this is something that Christian had once suggested.
I think that will be a good improvement for many other use cases as well.

Will that work for you?

It may not be me, it may be someone else, so there is a limit to my
commitment, but kernel developers usually abide by Linus' no regressions
rules (which do allow some slack).

Anyway, let's focus on what you would like best.
If you prefer to just fix the regression, it is doable.
If you prefer the upperdirfd, workdirfd, lowerdirfd API, I think we can
find a volunteer to write it up.

Thanks,
Amir.
