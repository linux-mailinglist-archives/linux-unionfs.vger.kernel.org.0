This is quite complex to understand. I think I still stick to general
stand that if any overlay feature stores any metadata info about
lower layer in upper layer, then we should not allow changes to
offline layers.  Otherwise there are so many possibilities to analyze
to figure out the effect of a offline change. It is confusing for
developers as well as users. So, IMHO, I will take simpler approach of
no lower layer modifications for all these advanced features otherwise
expect the unexpected. :-)
