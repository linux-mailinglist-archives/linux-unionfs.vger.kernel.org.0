So lookup_one_len() first does a cached lookup, and if found returns
that.  If not then it calls the filesystem's ->lookup() callback,
which in this case is ovl_lookup().  AFAICS ovl_lookup() will never
return ENOENT, even if the underlying filesystem does.

Which means it's not necessary to worry about that case.

The other case you found it that in case of a stale direntry the i_ino
update will be skipped and so it will return an inconsistent result,
right?   Fixing that looks worthwhile, yes.

Thanks,
Miklos
