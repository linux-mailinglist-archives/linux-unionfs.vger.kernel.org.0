Yeah, I was somewhat worried about this too, and this is the reason
the code is structured so that it only ever reads this new xattr for
whiteout files. The hope is indeed that they are uncommon enough in
practice to not make this a large issue.

One thing I noticed is that whiteouts are used in a bunch of places
for the handling of index files. I'm not completely up to speed on
these, but it looks like they are always in the work dir, am I right?
So, we could potentially avoid the check for a nowhiteout xattr for
these for a slight performance improvement. Correct?

I'll add some.

Yeah, that makes sense.
