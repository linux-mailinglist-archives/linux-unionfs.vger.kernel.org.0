The patches in the series were all merged, but we ended up going with a
simpler solution [1] than the first series I posted. Instead of plumbing
the errseq_t handling down into sync_fs, we did it in the syscall
wrapper.

I think the tricky part here is that there is no struct file plumbed
into ->sync_fs, so you don't have an errseq_t cursor to work with by the
time that gets called.

What may be easiest is to just propagate the s_wb_err value from the
upper_sb to the overlayfs superblock in ovl_sync_fs(). That should get
called before the errseq_check_and_advance in the syncfs syscall wrapper
and should ensure that syncfs() calls against the overlayfs sb see any
errors that occurred on the upper_sb.

Something like this maybe? Totally untested of course. May also need to
think about how to ensure ordering between racing syncfs calls too
(don't really want the s_wb_err going "backward"):

How about I split this into two patchsets? One, where I add the logic to copy
the errseq on callbacks to fsync from the upperdir to the ovl fs superblock,
and thus allowing VFS to bubble up errors, and the documentation. We can CC
stable on those because I think it has an effect that's universal across
all filesystems.

P.S. 
I notice you maintain overlay tests outside of the kernel. Unfortunately, I 
think for this kind of test, it requires in kernel code to artificially bump the 
writeback error count on the upperdir, or it requires the failure injection 
infrastructure. 

Simulating this behaviour is non-trivial without in-kernel support:

P1: Open(f) -> p1.fd
P2: Open(f) -> p2.fd
P1: syncfs(p1.fd) -> errrno
P2: syncfs(p1.fd) -> 0 # This should return an error
