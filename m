I think maybe it's best we hash this out here first.
What do you think about this version:

fs-verity support
----------------------

During metadata copy up of a lower file, if the source file has
fs-verity enabled and overlay verity support is enabled, then the
"trusted.overlay.verity" xattr is set on the new metacopy file. This
specifies the expected fs-verity digest of the lowerdata file, which is
used to verify the content of the lower file at the time the metacopy
file is opened.

When a layer containing verity xattrs is used, it means that any
such metacopy file in the upper layer is guaranteed to match the
content that was in the lower at the time of the copy-up. If at any time
(during a mount, after a remount, etc) such a file in the lower is
replaced or modified in any way, then opening the corresponding file on
overlayfs will result in EIO and a detailed error printed to the kernel log=
s.
(Actually, due to caching the overlayfs mount might still see the previous
file contents after a lower file is replaced under an active mount, but
it will never see the wrong data.)

Verity can be used as a general robustness check to detect accidental
changes in the overlayfs directories in use. But, with additional care
it can also give more powerful guarantees. For example, if the upper layer
is fully trusted (by using dm-verity or something similar), then an untrust=
ed
lower layer can be used to supply validated file content for all metacopy f=
iles.
If additionally the untrusted lower directories are specified as "Data-only=
",
then they can only supply such file content, and the entire mount can be
trusted to match the upper layer.
