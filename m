This is very cool - many thanks!

Unfortunately, I'm probably not the right person to code and identify
actual fixes, but I can test and describe results pretty well. :)

So I applied the patch (cleanly) to v6.9.3 (because I had it handy)
and mounted with "metadata=3Don". The first oddity is that the root ovl
directory shows no results for "ls /ovl" (there are lots of dirs in
the lower layer)
but if I do the same to a directory I know exists, it appears and
returns results just fine (e.g. ls /ovl/thing/blah). Then if I "ls
/ovl" again I see just /ovl/thing but none of the other dirs (until
also accessed by path).

Anyway, that doesn't really block further testing as the software I
load does not need to walk or interrogate the entries. So then I did a
"chown -h -R bob /blah/thing/stuff/version" and looked at the xattrs
of the upper - all the (metadata) files and dirs were brought up with
files having a redirect, but the dirs that should have
trusted.overlay.opaque=3Dz did not at this stage. Another followup "ls
-lR  /blah/thing/stuff/version" and now I can see the
trusted.overlay.opaque=3Dz where I would expect it to be.

But now when I lookup random NOENT files in those directories, I can
still see the lookup going across the network to the lower filesystem?
It looks like it's the same for the positive lookups - doing a stat
against a file that I know is in a trusted.overlay.opaque=3Dz directory
still sends the lookup over NFS (which it does not if the directory is
opaque=3Dy).

I mean, I expect a lookup for an existing file with a metadata
redirect to it for reads but not metadata stat() lookups? Also I would
expect no lookups to the lower for negative lookups? Unless we can't
serve negative lookups from the readdir of the upper dir?

I have probably misunderstood that the "finalized" directories will
only serve the contents of the readdir result and not send metadata
lookups to the lower level (ala dir=3Dopaque). Or my v6.9.3 kernel has
some other issue unrelated to this patch....
