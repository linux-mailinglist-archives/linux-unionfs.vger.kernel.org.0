Right you are.

As long as nothing picks it via d_find_any_alias() and moves it somewhere
manually.  The former might happen, the latter, AFAICS, doesn't - nothing
like d_move() anywhere in sight...

Correct; we only care if it gets reconnected to the main tree.
The fact that it's only for non-directories simplifies life a lot
there.  Sorry, got confused by the work you do with ->d_flags
and hadn't stopped to ask whether it's needed in the first place
in there.

OK, so... are there any reasons why simply calling d_obtain_alias()
wouldn't do the right thing these days?
