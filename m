Lots of applications do fsync of course.
Also copy up does fsync before moving the upper file into place.
Without this fsync (in volatile mode) upper files could very well be
corrupted even if applications never wrote to them anything and
never did fsync.

So is there a good reason to defer creation of incompat dir until
the first copy up or fsync? I don't think so.

Thanks,
Vivek
