Although it's a corner case, I think the deadlock is real.
All it takes is two different ovl mount with the same upper fs,
one is the lower of the other doing
    - upper sb_writers
     - lower ovl_inode_lock
      - upper sb_writers
during copy up.

Technically, to avoid the hack, we can remove ovl_want_write() from
ovl_copy_up_start() and do it individually for every low level helper that
needs to modify upper fs.
I can try to see how noisy this will be.

Thanks,
Amir.
