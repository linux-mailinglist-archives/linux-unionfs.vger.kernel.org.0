Hi Amir,

Thanks for quick response and detail information.=20

I think the simplest way is just store accounting info in memory(maybe  in =
s_fs_info).
At very first, I just thought  doing it for container use case, for contain=
er, it will be=20
enough because the upper layer is always empty at starting time and will be=
 destroyed=20
at ending time. =20

Adding a meta info to index dir is a  better solution for general use case =
but it seems
more complicated and I'm not sure if there are other use cases concern with=
 this problem.=20
Suggestion?

I'm not clear what the exact relationships between those indexes and nfs_ex=
port
but  if possible I hope having  separated switches for every index function=
s and a total
switch(index=3Dall) to enable all index functions at same time.

Dynamically changing inode limit  looks  too complicated to implement in ma=
nagement system
and having different quota limit during lifetime for same container may cau=
se confusion to sys admins.=20
So I still hope to solve this problem on overlayfs layer.
