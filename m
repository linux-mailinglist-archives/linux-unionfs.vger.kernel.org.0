Maybe I wasn't accurate in my explanation.

--verify is the only option that *adds* verifications.
I added it for backward compat because old kernels simply do not
pass those verifications (like const st_ino etc).
All the tests I added to xfstests use the --verify option because
want to test the upstream kernel and we want maximum test coverage.

--meta and --xino OTOH do not *add* verifications, they change the
validations that --verify does in subtle ways.

You will have to dive into the check_ functions for the details, they are
not pretty, but for example without --meta st_blocks is checked to be
positive after copy up of not empty file and with --meta it is checked to
be zero (which is actually wrong because xattr takes 1 block in xfs,
but let's not mix reality with theory for now).

Same goes for checks of st_dev and st_ino, they are always checked
for but expectations are different depending on xino and index.

IOW, if we do not parse the mount options to understand them and
just blindly set them, the verifications will likely fail.

Thanks,
Amir.
