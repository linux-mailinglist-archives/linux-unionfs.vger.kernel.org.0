Well, while looking up for index, we are checking for presence of
index dir (and not checking whether index is currently enabled or
not). So if somebody mounts overlayfs with index=on and later remounts
with index=off, we can still start looking up the index even if it
is not enabled. Is it intentional? If not, to simplify it, should
we lookup index only if it is enabled.

        if (origin && ofs->config.index &&
            (!d.is_dir || ovl_index_all(dentry->d_sb))) {
                index = ovl_lookup_index(ofs, upperdentry, origin, true);

What about the case of multiple lower layers. IIUC, we will only 
ensure that top most lower layer has file handle support and not
worry about rest of the layers. This will break the case of setting
origin for !upperdentry. This will lookup index and fail if lower
layer does not support file handle.

So may be while enabling index, we should make sure all lower
layers support file handles otherwise fail?

I agree. I want to simplify it too. Just trying to make sure that
I don't end up breaking some valid configuration.

We do not set origin on upper for broken hardlinks. So we will report
inode number from upper. I tried. it.

I tried following.

- touch foo.txt
- ln foo.txt foo-link.txt
- mount with metacopy=on
- chwon test:test foo.txt
- umount
- Goto upper/ and remove origin xattr from foo.txt. But there should not
  be one because we do not create ORIGIN for broken hardlinks if index is
  not enabled.
- mount overlay with index=on
- Do stat on foo.txt and foo-link.txt. foo.txt reports inode number from
  upper and foo-link.txt reports inode number from lower.
- chown test:test foo-link.txt
- stat foo-link.txt still reports inode number from lower.

Anyway, at this point of time, how about following.

- For non-upper dentry, always set origin.
- For upperdentry, there are 3 cases.
	- directories
	- regular files
	- regular metacopy files

  For directories and regular metacopy files only use verified origin.
  That means upper has origin xattr and it matches patch based looked
  up dentry. If we did not verify because either ORIGIN xattr is not
  there, or because index is not enabled or because ovl_verify_lower()
  is not set, then don't use path based looked up dentry as origin.

  For the case of regular file upper dentry, use unverified origin.
  It implies that ORGIN xattr is there. As there is no path based
  lookup origin for upper regular files. 

I am attaching a simple patch. Please let me know what do you think
of it.

Ok, will do.

Here is the patch to simplify the condition or origin. I will add some
changelog and comments in code in v2 of patch if you like the patch.
