Maybe.

would that include:
mount: lower=base,setup upper= updates
unmount
mount: lower=base,setup,updates upper=play
?

That might have happened.

That would be an improvement, as would errors=continue.

Either of these would let a healthy system come up and be usable, and
errors would let the system come up (finish booting) but the
nfs/overlay part needs attention.

Currently I have noauto so any reboot requires attention.
If I set auto, an error will cause the boot to stop and I don't have a
way to fix it remotely. I don't want to risk that, so noauto.

I think I would prefer errors=continue as It would be more obvious
that the overlayfs mount has issues.
