Hi Amir,

So with "upper on same as lower fs" contstraint we are just making it
little harder so that people don't use recreated lower with existing
upper? Is that the intention behind this constraint.

On a side note, I have a question about above commit. 

So this is basically the issue of upper stored file handle resolving to
a different file (in recreated lower). And we are considering this to
be a corner case. But the very fact a user was running into it, it
probably is not that hard to reproduce. So with the fix a888db310195,
we avoided the problem for simple configurations (no-index, no-metacopy,
and no xino). But if same user runs with index=on, with recreatd lower,
they can still run into similar issues?

Sure. I understand that. I am only harping on this to make sure
we tell people to not use this "recreated lower with existing upper".
In Pavel's use case, it is more of a cloned use case and not
re-created use case.

Otherwise people will re-create lower layers with regular filesystems and
use index=nouuid and then run into squashfs like issue one day.

Or we could document what Miklos had said. Using existing upper
with recreated lower will likely run into issues with advanced
overlay features like (index, metacopy, xino etc).

Interesing. Using virtiofs or a fuse passthrough filesystem on top
just to avoid uuid check will be lot of work. 

But keeping upper/ on same fs as lower fs constraint does not help with this.

So bottom line is that there are many ways where users can recreate
lower layers and run into issues.

- squashfs with index
- use a fuse passthrough filesystem
- use index=nouuid

So to me documenting that don't use existig upper with recreated lower
should help with all.

And putting a constraint of "lower and upper being on same fs" seems fine
for now but I am not sure it helps a lot. Anyway, I am fine with this
constratint. Just wanted to understand the rationale behind it.

Thanks
Vivek
