the data layer is constructed in a way that files are stored by their
hash and there is control from the container runtime on how this is
built and maintained.  So a file name collision would happen only when
on a hash collision.

Differently for the other layers we've no control on what files are in
the image, unless we limit to mount only one EROFS as the first lower
layer and then all the other lower layers are data layers.

Given your example above A:B::C:D, if both A and B are EROFS we are
limited in the files/directories that can be in B.

e.g. we have A/foo with the following xattrs:

trusted.overlay.metacopy=3D""
trusted.overlay.redirect=3D"/1e/de1743e73b904f16924c04fbd0b7fbfb7e45b864024=
1e7a08779e8f38fc20d"

Now what would happen if /1e is present as a file in layer B?  It will
just cause the lookup for `foo` to fail with EIO since the redirect
didn't find any file in the layers below.
