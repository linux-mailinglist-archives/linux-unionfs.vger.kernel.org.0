I spent some time on friday doing the initial work on this rework. In
case you want to look at it  I just pushed it to:

https://github.com/alexlarsson/linux/tree/overlay-verity

The first 3 commits are the same as before, and the last one is the
new approach. It's turned out pretty nice, simplifying things
considerable. But I really haven't had time to do a full re-review and
test of it, so please don't merge it yet. I'll spend Monday ensuring
it is in a good state for upstream.

Also, for the people following at home, ostree master has now landed
initial work for using composefs images for the root filesystem. The
initial work with minimal changes to ostree, but long term we are also
considering a complete rework of ostree based 100% on composefs.
Interested parties can follow this here:
