Those questions you can also ask Vivek if you find him in LPC...

I agree that a video meetup can be useful to kickoff this effort, but
it is preferred if Chengguang can also attend, because it feels like
you guys need to collaborate.

I cannot do LPC times today or tomorrow, but the hacker rooms are
open and judging by the time of your email you may be closer to my
time zone, so if you want to schedule a meeting somewhere in the next
5 hours, I can join. (7:00-12:00 UTC).

Otherwise, we can always schedule a call outside of LPC, where
participants not registered to LPC will be able to join (Chengguang?).

Thanks,
Amir.
