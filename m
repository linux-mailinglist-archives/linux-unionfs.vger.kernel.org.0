Hi Amir,

I ran above configurations and it passes with the patches.

Thanks for these suggestions. I used to run only "./run --ov" so far.
It will be nice to have some documentation about --meta, --verify in README.

This looks better. What about the case of non existing dentry with ctr=0.
In that case we will set origin to NULL. It still works but it probably
will be nice if we do.

	/* Always lookup index of non-upper */
	if (!upperdentry && ctr)
                 origin = stack[0].dentry;

Just making it explicit that we try to use lower as origin only if
some lower dentry was found.

Thanks
Vivek
