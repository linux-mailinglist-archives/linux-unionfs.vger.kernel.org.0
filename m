The problem rings a bell, but I would expect it had something to
do with the change:
a888db310195 ovl: fix regression with re-formatted lower squashfs

From v5.8.0 that was also applied to stable v5.4.y, so there is no
match to your report.

'No data available' means ENODATA error from getxattr()
which is not expected to be returned from operations like chmod() and
link() as you reported that is why the message makes no sense.
I did not find any internal vfs_getxattr() call in overlayfs code where
ENODATA can be exposed to the caller.

I did find that ENODATA could be exposed from lookup via a call to
ovl_verify_origin(), but that implies that the index feature is enabled
and is expected to print "overlayfs: failed to verify..." to kmsg.
We should probably replace the use visible lookup error with EIO,
but that in itself won't help users to understand the problem.

Do you use an existing upper (ext4) dir with a lower squashfs image that
is not the original image used when first mounting overlay with that upper dir
AND enable the index=on feature?
I still don't see how that would be a regression of kernel v5.8 and certainly
not v5.9.

Do you use any non default overlay config/mount options?

Please share the output of '/proc/self/mountinfo' with mounted overlay
and 'grep Y /sys/module/overlay/parameters/*'

Do you see any "overlayfs:" logs in kmsg?

If you do not need nfs export, you could try to create squashfs image with
-no-exports as a possible workaround.

Thanks,
Amir.
