If my understanding is correct (hopefully), I might ask if it's the
proposal to pass in multiple composefs manifests (rather than one)
all together to overlayfs in one shot?

If my understanding is correct, alternative one way might one do
a merged manifest before mounting? (of course a new manifest is
generated, but I think if it could be acceptable since the whole
merging process is under control?)

My overall thought is that it seems another seperate new
enhancement (if it needs more discussion) and have we might need
to land this lazy lookup first upstream as the first step?
(since our internal overlayfs users benefit this optimization
  as well... I'd like to see it upstream)

If it's a pure use case discussion, ignore me. ;)

Many thanks,
Gao Xiang
