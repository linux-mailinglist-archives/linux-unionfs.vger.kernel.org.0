Is it about detecting any writeback error on remount (which might
have happened after umount of volatile).

But that should be doable in user space too. That is when syncfs
is issued on upper/ it should return error if something failed.

Havind said that, I guess, Sargun does not want to issue sync on
upper due to its affect on other containers latencies. He probably
wants normal writeback and if there is an error in that writeback,
detect that error upon next mount of upper/. And all this is
detected by keeping a track of upper's super block id and erreseq_t
somewhere in overlay.

I have not looked at this patch yet, just guessing...
