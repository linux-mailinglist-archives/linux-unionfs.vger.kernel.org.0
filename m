Thanks Amir, the feature looks exactly what we need.

Hi Tao,

Would you have plan to update the patch "overlay: hardlink all whiteout fil=
es into a single one" in the recent future?
I'm trying to fix a issue regarding to inode limitation in container and in=
ode sharing with whiteout files is the key point to support the solution.


Thanks,
