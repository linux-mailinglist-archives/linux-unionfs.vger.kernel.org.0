What may confuse you is that Alexander has a tool mkfs.composefs
that creates hand crafted overlayfs, but it is not up to overlayfs.rst to
document this tool.

This patch set and documentation of the feature are standalone to
overlayfs and they affect and explain standard user workloads.

A "metacopy file" is one that has metadata changes in upper layer
but the data is still read from the lower layer.

The classic example, for which metacopy feature was developed is
chwon -R on a mounted overlay without having to copy up the data.

I agree that it would be good to clarify this term before using it.

With mount options metacopy=3Don,verity=3Don, once a file's metadata
was copied up, and its owner changed for the sake of the story, the
lower data file cannot be replaced with another file with different data
or without fsverity, while overlayfs is offline.

Those are all valid comments, but I don't think it would be fair to
require Alexander to fix the out of date documentation of overlayfs.

IMO, the documentation of verity feature should be judged for its
own clarity (and I myself find it pretty clear) assuming that the reader
is familiar with overlayfs and metacopy, but I will surely not object if
Alexander wants to help improve overlayfs.rst.

Thanks,
Amir.
