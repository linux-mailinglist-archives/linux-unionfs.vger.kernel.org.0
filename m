Open files are a separate issue and do need an active object in the server.

The issue this solves  is synchronizing "released" and "evicted"
states of objects between  server and client.  I.e. when a file is
closed (and no more open files exist referencing the same object) the
dentry refcount goes to zero but it remains in the cache.   In this
state the server could really evict it's own cached object, but can't
because the client can gain an active reference at any time  via
cached path lookup.

One other solution would be for the server to send a notification
(NOTIFY_EVICT) that would try to clean out the object from the server
cache and respond with a FORGET if successful.   But I sort of like
the file handle one better, since it solves multiple problems.

Thanks,
Miklos
