Not a regression - just something that I am sure was OK on my box,
then 20 min later the 'same thing' is causing problems.  We all know
it isn't the same, but this is what has me scratching my head.

img was
/dev/mapper/loop2p2 on /srv/nfs/rpi/buster/root/img type ext4 (rw,relatime)

sorry, I've reinstalled the os and I'm not having this problem any more.

no squashfs

the only difference between error and no error was

nfs_export=3Doff / on

Which is mostly why I posted - this little detail seemed odd.

maybe.  I'm futzing around with this pi image file trying to figure
out how to manage various flavors of modifications. .
I was hoping the lowest level would be the fs in the .img file, but
there isn't a nice way to deal with the loop devices, so I'll copy the
files onto the base ext5 fs and get on with things.

At the moment my little sysadmin project has lots of moving parts that
are not at all reliable, it's hard to tell what is and isn't working.
robust is the goal, I'm getting there.
