Thanks for presenting this topic at LSFMM!

I'm not an expert in overlayfs, but I've been working through this patchset.

One thing that seems to be missing, and has been tripping me up while reviewing
this patchset, is that the overlayfs documentation
(Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.rst) is not properly up to date with the
use case that is intended here.

For example, the overlayfs documentation says "An overlay filesystem combines
two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem and a 'lower' filesystem.".

Apparently, that is out of date.  I think a correct statement would be: An
overlay filesystem combines an optional upper directory with one or more lower
directories.

And as I understand it, the use case here actually involves two lower
directories and no upper directory.

There is also the "metacopy" feature, which the documentation describes in the
section "Metadata only copy up".  The documentation makes it sound like an
overlayfs internal optimization.

However, when this patchset introduces the fsverity support, it talks about
"metacopy files".  As I understand it, the user is expected to create a
read-only filesystem that contains these "metacopy files".  It doesn't seem to
be documented what these are, exactly, and how to create them.  I assume that
these are part of the implementation of "Metadata only copy up", but there seems
to be a gap where the documentation goes from describing the behavior of
"metadata only copy up", to expecting users of overlayfs to know what a
"metacopy file" is and how to create them.

I think that it would be easier to understand and review this feature if the
documentation was gotten up to date.
