Error on read is not an option because reading from an open and deleted
file is perfectly valid even without overlayfs.

ESTALE error on open is doable and makes sense and I believe it may
be sufficient for your use case.

I have an old branch that implements that behavior:
https://github.com/amir73il/linux/commits/ovl-revalidate

You can try it out and see if that works for you.
If it does, I can post the patches.

Note that the use case that you described does not need the last patch,
but if the anti-virus would have moved a lower file to quarantine
instead of deleting it, the last patch would also be useful for you.

Thanks,
Amir.
