I understand the problem and I understand why a // redirect to data-only la=
yers
would be a simple and workable solution for composefs.

Unlike the rest of the changes to overlayfs that we worked on to support
composefs, this would really be a composefs only on-disk format because it
could not be generated by overlayfs itself, so we need Miklos to chime in t=
o
say if this is acceptable.

I have one question though:

If you place all the blobs under /.cfs/1e/... is that really going to
be an issue?
I mean the middle layers are not random stuff and I don't think we need to =
worry
about malicious images blocking the data layers, because malicious images h=
ave
much easier ways of making damage.

It doesn't seem so likely for images to overload /.cfs by mistake with
anything other
than a proper composefs blobs repository (which should have no hash conflic=
ts)
and in the unlikely case that the image does happen to have a rogue /.cfs f=
ile
the container runtime can declare that image invalid for composefs mount.

Another observation: this problem reminds me of the "follow origin" [1] fea=
ture
I was working on a long time ago.

[1] https://github.com/amir73il/linux/commits/ovl-follow-origin

This work had a different use case and the patches (that follow directories=
)
are not relevant for this use case, but the same principle could be applied
to following metacopy to lowerdata by origin when the lowerdata cannot be
found by redirect (or redirected to "" to signify disconnected path).

Overlayfs copied up files and metacopy in particular have an "origin" xattr=
.
The "origin" xattr holds a file handle of the origin inode and uuid of
the origin layer.
This xattr has some uses, but I would like to point out one particular use =
-
in ovl_lookup() we use ovl_check_origin() to find a lower non-dir, so
that we can
use its i_ino for the overlay inode.

We do that also for non-metacopy and non-redirect. The special thing about
ovl_check_origin() is that it is blind to the problem that you described.
Unless the origin inode was deleted from the filesystem, overlayfs will fin=
d it.
The path of the found "origin" may not be known to overlayfs (i.e. disconne=
cted
dentry), but it also does not matter to overlayfs.

The reason I am telling you about this is because in the case that composef=
s
is used to create composefs layers on a specific machine or in a specific
local network, where the blobs are going to be stored on a specific
shared backing
filesystem, using "origin" instead of "redirect" as the way to refer
to the lower-data
might not be such a bad idea.

For example, in LSFMM, Lennart presented the idea of a system service that =
would
be able to provide "signed composefs image creation" services for unprivile=
ged
containers from standard OCI images. In that case, creating images
optimized for a
specific local blobs repository could be an option.

Apart from enabling composefs mount for unprivileged containers, the centri=
c
system service scheme could also be used to "optimize" distributed composef=
s
images to the local storage (i.e. convert //data redirect to origin referen=
ce).

Combined with Alex's verity feature, I think we could allow following lower=
data
by "origin" without any further opt-in from user, meaning:
If lowerdata cannot be found by path (or has intentional "" redirect)
AND if metacopy has verity xattr, defer to lazy lowerdata lookup,
where lowerdata would be looked up by origin.

Does this sound like something that would be useful for composefs ecosystem=
?
If it is, I could send a patch for testing.

Thanks,
Amir.
