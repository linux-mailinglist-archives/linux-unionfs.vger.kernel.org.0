I wanted to try and bring this thread back from the dead (?) as I
believe the use-case is still valid and worth supporting.  Some more
brief comments below ...

The basic idea is that we can now build Linux systems with enough
access control granularity such that a given process can have the
necessary privileges to mount a filesystem, but not necessarily access
all of the data on the filesystem, while other processes, with
different access rights, are allowed to read and write data on the
mounted filesystem.  Granted, this is a bit different from how things
are usually done, but in my opinion it's a valid and interesting use
case in that it allows us to remove unneeded access rights from
historically very privileged system startup services/scripts: the
service that runs to mount my homedir shouldn't be allowed to access
my files just to mount the directory.

Unfortunately, this idea falls apart when we attempt to use overlayfs
due to the clever/usual way it caches the mounting processes
credentials and uses that in place of the current process' credentials
when accessing certain parts of the underlying filesystems.  The
current overlayfs implementation assumes that the mounter will always
be more privileged than the processes accessing the filesystem, it
would be nice if we could build a mechanism that didn't have this
assumption baked into the implementation.

This patchset may not have been The Answer, but surely there is
something we can do to support this use-case.
