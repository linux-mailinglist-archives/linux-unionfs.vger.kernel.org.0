I can vouch that that's accurate, I'm doing nearly the same thing. The
properties of the NFS filesystem in terms of what is and is not expected
to change is identical for me, though my approach to incorporating
overlayfs has been a little different.

My confidence in the reliability of what I'm doing is still far from
absolute, so I will be interested in efforts to validate/officially
sanction/support/document related techniques.

The way I am doing it is with NFS as a data-only layer. Basically my use
case calls for presenting different views of NFS-backed data (it's
software libraries) to different applications. No application wants or
needs to have the entire NFS tree exposed to it, but each application
wants to use some data available on NFS and wants it to be presented in
some particular local place. So I actually wanted a method where I
author a metadata-only layer external to overlayfs, built to spec.

Essentially it's making overlayfs redirects be my symlinks so that code
which doesn't follow symlinks or is otherwise influenced by them is none
the wiser.

My approach doesn't support adding new files from the data-only NFS
layer after the overlayfs is created, of course, since the metadata-only
layer is itself the first lower layer and so would presumably get into
undefined-land if added to. But this arrangement does probably
mitigate this problem. Creating metadata inodes of a fixed set of
libraries for a specific application is cheap enough (and considerably
faster than copying it all locally) that the immutablity limitation
works for me.

So once you use opaque dirs and redirects on an upper layer, it's
sounding very similar to redirects into a data-only layer. In either
case you're responsible for producing metadata inodes for each NFS file
you want presented to the application/user.

This way seems interesting and more promising for adding NFS-backed
files "online" though.

I've been blissfully and naively assuming that it is based on intuition
:).

I think Daire and I are basically only adding new files to the NFS
filesystem, and both the all-opaque approach and the data-only approach
could prevent accidental access to things on the NFS filesystem through
the overlayfs (or at least portion of it meant for end-user consumption)
while they are still being birthed and might be experiencing changes.
At some point in the NFS tree, directories must be modified, but since
both approaches have overlayfs sourcing all directory entries from local
metadata-only layers, it seems plausible that the directories that
change aren't really "accessed by a overlayfs prior to the change."

How much proving/testing would you want to see before documenting this
and supporting someone in future who finds a way to prove the claim
wrong?

Clever.
