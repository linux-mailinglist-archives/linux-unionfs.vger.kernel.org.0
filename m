This is nice. I tried following and it seems to work.

UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR=/mnt/virtiofs/overlayfs-tests
UNIONMOUNT_MNTPOINT=/mnt/virtiofs/mnt

Got a question though. If somebody specifies a BASEDIR, whey not
automatically select mount point also inside that basedir. Is it because
of existing structure where basedir and mnt directory are separate and
defaults are different. Anway, I don't mind overlay mountpoint with
a separate environment variable.

What happens if I specify both UNIONMOUNT_LOWERDIR as well as
UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR. Does that mean only upper and work will be setup in
UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR.

So if UNIONMOUNT_LOWERDIR is empty and I specify a UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR and
use maxfs=<M>. All layers will still come from under UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR,
right?

What's most intuitive to me is this.

- If user only specifies UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR, all layers (lower, upper,
  work and even mount point) comes from that directory.

- If user specifies both UNIONMOUNT_LOWERDIR and UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR, then
  lower layer path comes from UNIONMOUNT_LOWERDIR and rest of the layers
  come from UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR.

- If user specifies UNIONMOUNT_MNTPOINT, it is used as overlay mount
  point. Otherwise one is selected from UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR if user
  specified one. Otherwise "/mnt" is the default.
