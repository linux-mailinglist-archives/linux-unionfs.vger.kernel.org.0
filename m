I still think that we should make it clear in documentation that
modifying and recreating lower layers is not allowed when advanced
features like metacopy/index/nfs_export/redirect_dir are enabled. If
one does so, expect the unexpected.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/20200709153616.GE150543@redhat.com/T/#t

To me, if we allow any random modification/recreation of lower filesystem,
then definiting the behavior in all the corner cases becomes hard and
it also makes design of overlayfs more complicated because anytime you
are implementing something, now you have to worry about modifications to
lower layer as well.

And I am also not aware of any good use cases which justify supporting
lower layer modification with new features. So remain of the opinion
that don't support it.

Thanks
Vivek
