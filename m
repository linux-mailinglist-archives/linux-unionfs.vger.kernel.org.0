It does not. "mv foo bar" gets -EXDEV and then mv copies up whole directory
tree. So even if lower layer is modified, we still see "bar/foo-child".

So behavior is little different in two cases. In one case, we lose
directory tree (as lower renamed it) and in another case we still
see it(because we copied it up).

Now one can argue that probably user will expect it (as long as they
know what redirect_dir does and all the semantics of copy up).

If our goal is that we need to allow this (as long as system does
not crash and does not throw errors) and all the resulting behaviors
can be explained away, then we probably don't need this patch.

I am not sure why do we need to allow updating lower and reuse with
same upper. It is hard to support these configurations and resulting
behavior. So with this patch I am trying to cut down the number
of options which allow this configuraiton.

In general, if any overlay features stores metadata in upper about lower
layer, then with lower layer change, that metadata can be broken. And
we probably should not allow such configuraiton. I am approaching it
from this angle. (until and unless there is a strong use case that
why we need to continue to support it with newer overlay features).

Thanks
