Use the memalloc_nofs_save/restore design pattern will avoid all that
grief.
As a matter of fact, this issue could and should be handled inside security
subsystem without bothering any other subsystem.
LSM have per task context right? That context could carry the recursion
flags to know that the getxattr call is made by the security subsystem itself.
The problem is not limited to union filesystems.
In general its a stacking issue. ecryptfs is also a stacking fs, out-of-tree
shiftfs as well. But it doesn't end there.
A filesystem on top of a loop device inside another filesystem could
also maybe result in security hook recursion (not sure if in practice).

Thanks,
Amir.
