When I replace `touch foo.txt` with `echo 123 > foo.txt` I observe the
same behavior.  If I understand you correctly, you are saying that EIO
is correct for non-empty files, but potentially incorrect for empty
files (which could be copied rather than redirected, since there is no
space saving)?

After reflection, EIO probably makes the most sense for open/stat.  It
might be nice to be able to unlink the file to allow recovery (in the
sense of being able to reuse the name) without unmounting the overlay,
but the documentation updates may be sufficient to keep users from
getting into this state.

That sounds good to me.  My current use case involves offline changes to
the lower layer on a routine basis, and I interpreted the current
wording "Offline changes, when the overlay is not mounted, are allowed
to either the upper or the lower trees." to mean that such offline
modifications would not break things in unexpected ways.

In retrospect, I should have expected this behavior, but as someone
previously unfamiliar with overlayfs, I hadn't considered that metacopy
results in file redirects and that if the underlying file were removed
without removing any redirects pointing to it that it would manifest in
this way and be so difficult to clean up.

If metacopy and dir_redirect are disabled, are offline modifications to
the lower layer permitted, or could any such modification result in
undefined behavior?

Ah, indeed.  Would doing so for missing/invalid metacopy/redirect make
sense?

Thanks for the patch!  (Especially so quickly.)  I'll try it out soon.

Thanks again,
Kevin
