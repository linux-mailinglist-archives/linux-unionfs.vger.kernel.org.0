That still has the incorrect statement "If at any time (during a mount, after a
remount, etc) such a file in the lower is replaced or modified in any way, then
opening the corresponding file on overlayfs will result in EIO and a detailed
error printed to the kernel logs."  See my last email where I explained why that
statement is not correct.
