In the past we were experimenting with chowning all files in image
according to user namespace of container using metacopy and use chowned
dir as lower layer for container rootfs. Ofcourse now, idmapped mounts
are available (not sure if it works with overlayfs yet or not) so chowning
images should not be required.

But point I am trying to make it is that I will not be surprised
that somebody comes up with use case of metacopy inode in lower
layer. So will be nice we take care of that configuration as well
while enabling metacopy with nfs_export (and deal with extra
complexity).
