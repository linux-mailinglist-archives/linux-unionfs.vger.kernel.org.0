After applying the branch, I tested the scenario.
But it does not work. file open is success on overlayfs filesystem.

In my scnario, the dentry is not negative and just unhashed on upper.
If we check dentry is unhashed we properly block open on my scenario.
I write the patch and tested it working.
(Maybe I does not catch your point, if you give a guide then I follow it)

And I have one more question.
Why upper dir must be visible..?  
The reson I think making upper dir unvisible is like the below.
1. If making a upperdir is unvisible, then these kind of problem disappear.
2. upperdir visibility makes a passage to convey container's file to hostland. 
(in view of container using overlayfs)
making unvisible remove this kind of problem.
3. Changing upper dir scenario makes undefined behavior. So, if removing the interface
user can access, then we can make the undefined scenario itself.

Thanks Amir.
Best regards
