That's good to hear. Thank your for taking the time to read and think

They have their use-cases for pseudo-filesystems or overlay filesystems
such as overlayfs. So I always appreciated Seth's idea and work to
enable this (see [1]).

However, they have too many limitations for a lot of use-cases. From a
pure security perspective as they are not easily useable for fileystems
that parse user provided images. But also because they apply filesystem
wide which renders a whole range of use-cases completely infeasible.

Yes.
Below, I'll be using the 'u' prefix to indicate a raw device or
userspace id and the 'k' prefix to indicate a kernel id generated by
make_k*id() when the inode cache is initialized (same as I did in the
documentation you read).

Now say we have an xfs filesystem with a bunch of files that are stored
on-disk with the following ownership:

dir id:       u0
dir/file1 id: u1000
dir/file2 id: u2000

If we mount this xfs filesystem in the init_user_ns and these files are
read into the inode cache the i_*id_write() helper is called. The
helpers is then passed the on-disk id. It will call make_k*id()
internally and map the on-disk id into a k*id according to the idmapping
of the userns the filesystem is mounted in.

If the xfs filesystem is mounted in the init_user_ns the the on-disk
_value_ is identical to the _value_ stored in i_{g,u}id:

dir i_*id:       k0
dir/file1 i_*id: k1000
dir/file2 i_*id: k2000

If we _pretend_ for a minute it were possible to mount an xfs filesystem
in a userns with an idmapping of 0:10000:10000 then the value stored
on-disk would be different from the value stored in i_*id. The values in
i_*gid of struct inode would be:

dir i_*id:       k10000
dir/file1 i_*id: k11000
dir/file2 i_*id: k12000

So the i_*id values would be mapped into the userns. Consequently the fs
becomes useable for callers within that userns.

So when userns root creates a new file i_*id_read() will be passed
k10000. When the inode is written to disk the mapping needs to be
undone. So i_*id_read() is called which will map k10000 back to the
on-disk value u0 which is then stored on-disk.

Yes, because overlayfs itself doesn't write anything to disk. The fs
used for the upperdir is doing that.

Provided that upperdir is writable, yes.

Yes.
