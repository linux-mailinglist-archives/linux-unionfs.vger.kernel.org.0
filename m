You don't need lowermetacopy for that. you can check d.metacopy
directly.

I agree it should be simplified.
If you cannot figure out how, let me know and I will try.

Move that test up to where setting metacopy = true for lower layers
similar to "refusing to follow redirect" and make it:
       if (uppermetacopy || d.metacopy) {

Then you got rid of lowermetacopy.

I think this should be:

          * Always lookup index of non-dir and non-upper.
          */
          if (!origin && ctr && (!upperdentry || !d.is_dir))
                 origin = stack[0].dentry;

uppermetacopy is guaranteed to either have origin already set or
exit with an an error for ovl_verify_origin().

HOWEVER, if we set origin to lower, which turns out to be a lower
metacopy, we then skip this layer to the next one, but origin remains
set on the skipped layer dentry, which we had already dput().
Ay ay ay!

I think it would be best to move the check
                 * Do not store intermediate metacopy dentries in chain,
to right after ovl_lookup_layer(), before the ovl_fix_origin() and
ovl_verify_origin() checks.

Thanks,
Amir.
