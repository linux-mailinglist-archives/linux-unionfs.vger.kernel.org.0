How about calling upper/work root as UNIONMOUNT_UPPER_WORK_ROOT instead.
That's more intuitive as oppsed to BASEDIR. But I understand that due 
to legacy reasons there must be many other assumptions in the code so
it might not be trivial.

What will help though, that document these options well, so that
those who don't read the code and still understand use different
config options.

If I specify UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR, then --samefs should be implied?
