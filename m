If 6.6 is what ends up happening I'm not gonna protest, it's not a
huge issue for me, only mildly inconvenient. But, for now I'll at
least keep targeting 6.5, and then we will have to see how it works
out wrt reviews and what Miklos decides.

I pushed out a v5 series today too, because the v4 series conflicted
with some other changes in vfs.all that are staged for 6.5. v5 is also
a bit simplified based on Amirs feedback, has some documentation
updates and is refactored into more commits for easier review.
