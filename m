Hey everyone,
I'm inclined to agree with Amir here. The userspace tools can be 
improved / extended, but it's not the scope of the kernel documentation.

Thought Overlayfs will try to handle those changed files in a way it may not result in a crash or deadlock, you shouldn't do it. Due to multiple reasons involving caches, attributes, and others, if the underlying filesystem is changed, the behavior of the overlay gets "undefined", so you can't trust it anymore.

They are almost supported if the “metacopy”, “index”, “xino” and “redirect_dir” features have not been used. If the lower tree is modified and any of these features has been used before on this overlay, the behavior can also get "undefined".

Just say: "I want the feature of overlayfs, but for this specific directory, I want it to write on lower". The provided solution writes on the underlying filesystems (through bind), even if the result is quite predictable and almost works. Now I understand better the way overlayfs is working, I think there should be a warning in the documentation (that chatGPT or others may read next time) regarding this:

But mind the interactions you could create outside of overlayfs using tools like bind mounts, "rsync" or even "cp" between upper filesystem (or merged) and lower ones. Those lead to changes to the underlying filesystems and should be avoided as already stated.
