Yes, I'm aware of that, but do we need to describe this in the
overlayfs documentation?
The text I wrote is describing the behaviour that overlayfs adds to
the mix, and I sort of
assumed the late validation from fs-verity itself would be known about
if the file already
has fs-verity enabled.

I guess just adding a link to that is not that bad. What about:

----
When a layer containing verity xattrs is used, it means that any such
metacopy file in the upper layer is guaranteed to match the content
that was in the lower at the time of the copy-up. If at any time
(during a mount, after a remount, etc) such a file in the lower is
replaced or modified in any way, then opening the corresponding file
on overlayfs will result in EIO and a detailed error printed to the
kernel logs.  (Actually, due to caching the overlayfs mount might
still see the previous file contents after a lower file is replaced
under an active mount, but it will never see the wrong data.)  In
addition fs-verity will do late validation of the file content, as
described in :ref:`Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst
<accessing_verity_files>`.
