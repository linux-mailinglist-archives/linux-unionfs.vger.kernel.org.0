Sounds right.
Just don't rely on the workdir cleanup error yes?
That protection is for old kernels and it falls back to r/o mount.
New kernel should of course recognise $(workdir)/work/incompat/volatile
fail to mount and explicitly error about unclean "volatile" unmount and
maybe give a hint how to fix it in kernel log.
