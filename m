If it was up to me I think I'd keep it even more "minimal" just do:

        struct ovl_verity {
                u8 version;     /* 0 */
                u8 algo;        /* digest algo */
                u8 digest[];
        };

It's up to you, though.  Keep in mind, the definition of a fsverity digest as
algorithm ID + raw digest is pretty fundamental to fsverity.  It's not
especially prone to change.  The confusion we had was just over what type of
algorithm ID to use.

(There is some inconsistency about whether the algorithm ID is u8, u16, or u32.
However, it's u8 on-disk in the fsverity_descriptor.  So it's fine for the
overlayfs xattr to use u8.)

I think you're asking about the raw_digest argument to fsverity_get_digest()?
No, there's no alignment requirement.
