No reason. I think it's a good idea. I'll do it.

Yes, work and upper and with --ov=N also middle layers.

Yes, but note that while the *path* of all layers is under UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR,
namely $UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR/$N/{u,w}, some layers will use the basedir fs,
while others will have a tmpfs instance mounted at $UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR/$N/.
M from maxfs=<M> determines the number of middle layers using tmpfs instances.

Now that I think about it, this setup should use $UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR/lower
as lowerdir path and it uses /lower.
I'll need to fix that.

OK.

DONE.

OK.

Thanks for valuable feedback,
