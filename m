Exactly.

But I think I'd merge it as-is, git submodule brings more maintain
burden on both maintainers and users, especially users that usually
don't care about overlay tests. Users that care about overlay tests
should setup unionmount tests explicitly and know that's unionmount
tests if there's any test failure.

Agreed, I think making unionmount tests a built-in would be good in the
future.
