I can see how this is wrong.

On the other hand it took us some time to explain our release managers
that kernel is OK when we say that it's OK and that the actuall test
results are not the end result. But even then we never attempted to
to put workarounds into the upstream tests. So I guess that we can
remove the workaround when there is a fix in upstream.

It's even worse with the distribution kernels that have arbitrary
version numbers and thousands of patches on the top of it, so we use it
as a last option...
