Yes, for the use case of chowning all files sure cannot rely on caches
and I believe those containers are also used as persistent containers
that can be mounted again later after initial ownership fix.

I guess that depends what are the use cases that benefit.
After all it is not a security fix it just increases the amount of
use cases that preserve the append-only flag.

I *think* it could fix a lot of cases like:
chmod foo; drop_caches; touch foo # should fail
mv foo bar; drop_caches; touch bar # should fail

and in order to lose the append-only flag, users will need to
first open with O_APPEND, set noatime flag or some unusual
operations that do not happen by mistake as often as chmod,chown,rename.

Sure, unless the user is not privileged to set flags, but copy up will stil=
l
happen. But what I meant is if user changes the flags, data copy up
happens and ovl_copyflags() after drop caches will no longer copy the
lower flags.

Thanks,
