Consider the case of a writable open file: the mount write access is
only checked on open.  So not having fine grained mnt write access
checks is not without precedent.

I'm not sure, but the number of added lines in this particular patch
makes me think that at least during copy-up we could separate the mnt
and the sb write locks.

You mean notifying overlayfs about rdonly remount of upper mnt?  No,
that doesn't exist today.

Thanks,
