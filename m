Add "xino" to the list of features which cause undefined behavior for
offline changes to the lower tree in the "Changes to underlying
filesystems" section of the documentation to make users aware of
potential issues if the lower tree is modified and xino was enabled.

This omission was noticed by Amir Goldstein, who mentioned that xino is
one of the "forbidden" features for making offline changes to the lower
tree and that it wasn't currently documented.
