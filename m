This is expected. Does it cause any problem?

The patch marks the lower squashfs as "bad_uuid", because:
        if (!ofs->config.index && uuid_is_null(uuid))
                return false;
...
        if (!ovl_lower_uuid_ok(ofs, &sb->s_uuid)) {
                bad_uuid = true;
...
        ofs->fs[ofs->numfs].bad_uuid = bad_uuid;

That's ofs->fs[1].bad_uuid = bad_uuid;


Then in ovl_lookup() => ovl_check_origin() => ovl_check_origin_fh()
will return ESALE because of:
                if (ofs->layers[i].fsid &&
                    ofs->layers[i].fs->bad_uuid)
                        continue;

And ovl_check_origin() will return 0 to ovl_lookup().

When problems are you observing?

Maybe I did not understand the problem.

Thanks,
Amir.
