No, for the sake of this section, it would be easier to say
that upper is completely trusted and completely under our
control and that the feature only hardens overlayfs when
lower is not under our full control.

In the case of composefs it's actually two lower layers, one trusted
and one not trusted (and an optional trusted upper), but it does not
matter IMO for the sake of explaining the basic feature.

Right.

They are. doc should not mention online.

Fair enough.

Alex,

Please incorporate Eric's feedback above to come up with a more
detailed description than:

+This can be useful as a way to validate that a lower directory matches
+the correct upper when it is re-mounted later. In case you can
+guarantee that a overlayfs directory with verity xattrs is not
+tampered with (for example using dm-verity or fs-verity) this can even
+be used to guarantee the validity of an untrusted lower directory.
+

On the specific points that Eric mentioned.

Thanks,
Amir.
