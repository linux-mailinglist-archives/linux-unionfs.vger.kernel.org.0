Painful example.
Next time please draw the top most layers on top and
not on bottom. I think it will be clearer this way.

I think that the first thing to do would be to minimize the requirements.
I have lost track of the use cases and possible combinations of ostree
containers and unprivileged users.

Perhaps narrowing the requirement can simplify the design?

One option that we should consider - it may simplify the design a bit -
use an opt-in mount option to support interpreting escaping xattrs.
It may be wise to opt-in to this feature anyway - less chance for
regressions we did not think about.

This means you can use xwhiteouts with no need of marking the
containing directories. ovl_calc_d_ino() would just blindly check for
ofs->config.<something>.

Would the opt-in mount option be a problem to your use cases?

Thanks,
Amir.
