Yes, that should work for fine afaict. I think that overlayfs
conceptually is equivalent to a permanent writer on that mount where
write access is granted during mount.

(I guess overlayfs could yield write access to the underlying mounts
when it gets an SB_FORCE/emergency remount request.)

No, I don't think so (see my other mail for emergency remount). There's
definitely no public one as private mounts are "invisible" to userspace
and can't be interacted with.
