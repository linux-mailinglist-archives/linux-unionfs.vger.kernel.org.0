Maybe. It wouldn't be the first time ;-)
IIRC the idea to lookup metacopy by path+redirect was Miklos' not mine.
I was thinking in terms of following by origin back then.

The eventual code in ovl_lookup() follows upper by origin and all layers
by path+redirect and only checks for agreement of origin and redirect from
upper layer.

Implementing "follow metacopy in middle layers by origin" in ovl_obtain_alias()
is possible and even not too complicated, but it would be inconsistent
with ovl_lookup() and if somebody mangaled with lower layers (i.e. rename
lower file), decode file handle can result in a different inode than the encoded
one.

In that case we have several options:
1. Whatever - documentation already claims that modifying lower layer
    after using index/metacopy results in undefined behavior
2. Fortify ovl_lookup() - also follow origin from middle layers and check
    for agreement with follow by path+redirect

Certainly. I agree with that POV. We just need to understand the
consequences.

I personally have no problem with the "Whatever" option above.
And the "Fortify" option isn't that complex either.

I just thought that if Zhihao Cheng wanted to start with minimal
testable implementation, that limiting nfs_export+metacopy to a single
lower layer, may be an easier start.

Overlayfs nfs_export is quite likely being used in OpenWrt and IIUC,
OpenWrt uses a single (squashfs) lower layer.

Therefore, enabling metacopy for the single lower layer case may be
valuable to some actual users and not only as a stepping stone before a
complete solution.

Thanks,
Amir.
