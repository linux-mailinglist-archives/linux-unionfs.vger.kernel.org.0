My branch is just a POC.
If you test it and say that it is useful for you I can post it
and add your use case as the motivation.

That won't be enough and is also not accurate.
I pushed another patch to branch ovl-revalidate and also
tested that your use case works as expected when
deleting either upper or lower non-dir files.

The patch adds this functionality unconditionally for non-dir,
but it may be required to use some mount option to enable it.
It is up to Miklos to decide.

Please test the patch that I pushed to branch ovl-revalidate.

It is not meaningful, it is not relevant.
There is no way to hide a directory.
You can bind mount an empty dir over it in one mount namespace
but in other mount namespaces or other bind mounts that dir will be visible.

Thanks,
Amir.
