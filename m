Hi Amir,

I am running these tests with.

UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR="/mnt/foo/"

- ./run --ov runs fine. But when I try to run it again it complains
  that.

  rm: cannot remove '/mnt/overlayfs//m': Device or resource busy

So I have to first unmount /mnt/overlayfs/m/ and then run tests
again.

I think it will be nice if it can clear the environment by itself.

- I am running one the recent kernel (5.7.0+) and following errors
  out.

# ./run --ov --verify
Environment variables:
UNIONMOUNT_BASEDIR=/mnt/overlayfs/

***
*** ./run --ov --samefs --ts=0 open-plain
***
TEST open-plain.py:10: Open O_RDONLY
/mnt/overlayfs/m/a/foo100: not on union mount

Will spend more time to figure out what happened.

- I am planning to use these environment variables and run overlay over
  virtiofs tests. Can I do the same thing with xfstests overlay tests.
  In README.overlay I see that I need to specify two separate devices.
  Can I specify to directories (and not devices) to be used as TEST
  and SCRATCH and run overlay test.

Thanks
Vivek
