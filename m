This approach seems quite wrong.
For one thing, mount cycle overlay or drop caches will result in loss
of append only flag after copy-up, so this is not a security fix.

Second, Miklos has already proposed a much more profound change
to address this and similar issues [1] and he has already made some
changes to ioctl handler to master doesn't have ovl_iflags_to_fsflags().

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20201123141207.GC327006@miu.piliscsaba.redhat.com/

One more thing.
It seems like ovl_copyflags() in ovl_inode_init() would have been better
to copy from ovl_inode_realdata() inode instead of ovl_inode_real().
This way, copy up still loses the append-only flag, but metacopy up
does not. So at least for the common use case of containers that
chown -R won't cause losing all the file flags.

ovl_ioctl_set_flags() triggers data copy up, so that will break the link
to lower flags anyway.

I also noticed that we can lose the immutable flag on lower directory
when copying up parents and it's probably not the only way to
lose an immutable flag on a lower file/dir.

Thanks,
Amir.
