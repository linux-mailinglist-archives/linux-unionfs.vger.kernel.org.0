Well, I didn't do it to silence lockdep. I did it as a prereq for
start-write-safe fsnotify hooks (see [1] above).
Silencing lockdep is an added bonus that I observed along the way.

v2 [2] has a less hacky, but more noisy version of this patch which
minimizes the scope of ovl_want_write() to when we need it.
Let me know if this is what you had in mind.

After looking more closely, I found another possible deadlock with
nested overlay, which I think is real and added another commit to fix it.
