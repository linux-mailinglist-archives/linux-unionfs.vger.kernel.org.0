What do you mean by remount? actual -o remount cannot
change any overlay config variables.
For umount/mount,  ofs->indexdir doesn't mean that there is an
index dir, it means that index dir is in use because index is enabled.
See:

        if (!(ovl_force_readonly(ofs)) && ofs->config.index) {
...
                err = ovl_get_indexdir(sb, ofs, oe, &upperpath);
...
        if (!ofs->indexdir) {
                ofs->config.index = false;

Most of the code checks for ofs->indexdir.
The test for ofs->config.index is also correct, but inconsistent, although
I see that we also use ofs->config.index in other places in ovl_lookup().

Enabling index requires that all layers support file handles:

                pr_warn("fs on '%s' does not support file handles,
falling back to index=off,nfs_export=off.\n",
                        name);
        }

Good point. I figured we had to have some protection in place.

As I wrote in review, the condition could be further simplified to
(!upperdentry).

Thanks for digging up the truth,
Amir.
