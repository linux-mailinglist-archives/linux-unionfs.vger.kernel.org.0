This is not a big problem actually as these options shown in mountinfo 
for overlay had been "output only" forever, please see these two 
examples below:

a) Imagine you've mounted overlay with relative paths and forgot (or you 
never known as you are another user) where your cwd was at the moment of 
mount syscall. - How would you use those options as "input" to create 
the same overlay mount somethere else (bind-mounting not involved)?

b) Imagine you've mounted overlay with absolute paths and someone (other 
user) overmounted lower (upper/workdir) paths for you, all directory 
structure would be the same on overmount but yet files are different. - 
How would you use those options from mountinfo as "input" ones?

We try to make them much closer to "input" ones.

Agreed, we should ignore *_mnt_id on mount because paths identify mounts 
at the time of mount call.

Pair of fhandle+mnt_id looks an equivalent to path+mnt_id pair, CRIU 
will just need to open fhandle+mnt_id with open_by_handle_at and 
readlink to get path on dump and continue to use path+mnt_id as before. 
(not too common with fhandles but it's my current understanding)

But if you take a look on (a) and (b) again, the regular user does not 
see full information about overlay mount in /proc/pid/mountinfo, they 
can't just take a look on it and understand from there it comes from. 
Resolving fhandle looks like a too hard task for a user.

Children mounts lock parent, open files lock parent. Another analogy is 
a loop device which locks the backing file mount (AFAICS). Anyway one 
can lazy umount, can't they? But I'm not too sure for this one, maybe 
you can share more implications of this problem?

We wan't to dump a container, not a simple process, if the container 
process has access to some resource CRIU needs to restore this resource.

Imagine the process in container mounts it's own overlay inside 
container, for instance to imulate write access to readonly mount or 
just to implement some snapshots, don't know exact use case. And we want 
to checkpoint/restore this container. (Currently CRIU only supports 
overlay as external mount, e.g. for docker continers docker engine 
pre-creates overlay for us and we just bind from it - it's a different 
case.) If the in-container process creates the in-container mount we 
need to recreate it on restore so that the in-container view of the 
filesystem persists.

On restore we can be on another physical node, so I doubt we have same 
uuid's, sorry I don't fully understand here already.

Thanks xattr might be a good option, but still don't forget about (a) 
and (b), users like to know all information about mount from 
/proc/pid/mountinfo.
