Your detailed description lead me straight to the bugs :)

Was a silly bug - failure to initialize root dentry correctly.
It was also observed by several fstests that now pass.

Second silly bug.

ovl will lookup the lower data of a metacopy file at lookup time.
Perhaps we could do lazy lookup of data files, like we do with
data-only layers, but this would be more complicated and in any
case, stat(2) needs the lower data file to present the correct
value of st_blocks.

IOW, this patch mainly helps to prevent *negative* lookups
in the lower layers.

Correct expectation.
The bug was fixed. It should hopefully work now,
although I did not test.

You understood almost correctly, but you need to understand that
the finalized directory is not completely opaque, it is partly opaque.
You can visualize this as painting the space "between entries" opaque,
so that negative lookup results will stop as well as readdir, but ovl
will still look *underneath* entries.

BTW, ovl will also lookup in lower dirs if entries inside an upper
opaque dir have an absolute path redirect xattr.
This type of upper opaque dir is also called "impure" and has an
"impure" xattr.

So you may say that the difference between an opaque=y
dir and opaque=z dir is that in the latter, all entries are treated
as if they have an absolute path redirect (to their own path),
but that is a very hand wavy way of putting it.

Anyway, if you are happy with the patch and want to see it upstreamed,
I have few requests:

1. Please provide your Tested-by.
2. Please provide a detailed cover letter that explains the problem (*)
    and how the patch fixes it, which includes performance gain numbers.
    You may post the cover letter with my patch or ask me to do it
3. Please write an fstest to test the finalized dir feature (**)
    You may want to look at test overlay/031 for inspiration
    if also makes changes to layers offline and examines the outcome

(*) Please do NOT include the story of changing lower entries
    under a mounted overlayfs - they are not relevant to this patch
    and they are very controversial.
(**) Basically do chown -R and ls, unmount overlay, add lower entry
    re-mount overlay and verify that it is not observed.
    Can also sanity check that opaque=z was set.
    Note that adding lower entries offline is a behavior that was once allowed
    and some users actually expect it to work, so I made the feature
    depend on !ovl_allow_offline_changes(ofs).
    Therefore, the test should explicitly require and enable metacopy for
    overlayfs mount to enable the finalized dir feature.

Thanks,
Amir.
