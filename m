I think this is not to handle large folio for overlayfs, it is about vma
alignment or vma allocation for memory mapped files,


1) many fs support THP mapping, using thp_get_unmapped_area(),

fs/bcachefs/fs.c:       .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/btrfs/file.c:        .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/erofs/data.c:        .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/ext2/file.c: .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/ext4/file.c: .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/fuse/file.c: .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,
fs/xfs/xfs_file.c:      .get_unmapped_area = thp_get_unmapped_area,

2) and some fs has own get_unmapped_area callback too,

fs/cramfs/inode.c:	.get_unmapped_area	= cramfs_physmem_get_unmapped_area,
fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:	.get_unmapped_area	= hugetlb_get_unmapped_area,
fs/ramfs/file-mmu.c:	.get_unmapped_area	= ramfs_mmu_get_unmapped_area,
fs/ramfs/file-nommu.c:	.get_unmapped_area	= ramfs_nommu_get_unmapped_area,
fs/romfs/mmap-nommu.c:	.get_unmapped_area	= romfs_get_unmapped_area,
mm/shmem.c:	.get_unmapped_area = shmem_get_unmapped_area,

They has own rules to get a vma area, but with overlayfs(tries to
present a filesystem which is the result over overlaying one filesystem
on top of the other), we now only use the default
mm_get_unmapped_area_vmflags() to get a vma area, since the overlayfs
has no '.get_unmapped_area' callback.

do_mmap
   __get_unmapped_area
     // get_area = NULL
     mm_get_unmapped_area_vmflags
   mmap_region
     mmap_file
       ovl_mmap

It looks wrong, so we need to get the readfile via ovl_real_file()
and use realfile' get_unmapped_area callback, and if the realfile
is not with the callback, fallback to the default
mm_get_unmapped_area(),

> 

So maybe use mm_get_unmapped_area() instead of __get_unmapped_area(),
something like below,

+static unsigned long ovl_get_unmapped_area(struct file *file,
+               unsigned long addr, unsigned long len, unsigned long pgoff,
+               unsigned long flags)
+{
+       struct file *realfile;
+       const struct cred *old_cred;
+
+       realfile = ovl_real_file(file);
+       if (IS_ERR(realfile))
+               return PTR_ERR(realfile);
+
+       if (realfile->f_op->get_unmapped_area) {
+               unsigned long ret;
+
+               old_cred = ovl_override_creds(file_inode(file)->i_sb);
+               ret = realfile->f_op->get_unmapped_area(realfile, addr, len,
+                                                       pgoff, flags);
+               ovl_revert_creds(old_cred);
+
+               if (ret)
+                       return ret;
+       }
+
+       return mm_get_unmapped_area(current->mm, file, addr, len, pgoff, 
flags);
+}

Correct me If I'm wrong.

Thanks.
