I went over almost all patches which you have in ovl-aops-wip branch.
For now I have only ported some of the straight forward patches,
since I had few queries on those other patches and one was mainly
w.r.t. metadata only feature functionality.

Do you have sometime today to discuss about it in any of the LPC hacker
room? I was thinking maybe discussing this in person will help a lot.

Any preferred slot? I could not find you online on LPC chat area,
we can as well discuss the slot there. But I am fine with any of the LPC
timings.
