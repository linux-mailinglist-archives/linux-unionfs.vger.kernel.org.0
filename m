Found another interesting problem while I cleared ATTR_OPEN. VFS also
sets ATTR_FILE and attr->ia_file has ovl file pointer. ovl_setattr() does not
look at this attribute and passes it to underlying layer as it is. Fuse
thinks it got a valid file object and passes file handle to server and
server complains -EBADF.

ext4/xfs don't seem to look at ATTR_FILE, so it did not create problems
so far. 

For now, I will simply reset ATTR_FILE, indicating to lower layers
don't use attr->ia_file.

Thanks
Vivek
