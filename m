On one hand you are saying redirect=nofollow is paranoia, most people
don't understand it and don't use it. And on top of that you want
to add more to it. Adding more to something which nobody does not
understand and uses, sounds like more trouble to me.

Anyway, before we go further into this, what's the use case. Why
do you want to provide option to disable following origin for non-dir?
