I think it goes without saying that the amount of
similar-but-slightly-different-and-inconsistently-named functions
that have simply grown organically as individual fs needs have
occurred has resulted in a bit of a mess that nobody really wants to
tackle... :/

I like the idea, but I don't think that overloading I_NEW is the
right thing to do nor is it that simple.

e.g. We added the I_CREATING state years ago as a subset of I_NEW so
that VFS inodes being instantiated can't be found -at all- by the
open-by-handle interface doing direct inode hash lookups. However,
only some of the inode hash APIs add this flag, and only overlay as
a filesystem adds it in certain circumstances.

IOWs, even during initialisation, different filesystems need to
behave differently w.r.t. how the core VFS performs various
operations on the inode during the initialisation stage...

FWIW, XFS has the XFS_INEW state that wraps around the outside of
the VFS inode initialisation process that prevents it from being
found via any type of inode cache lookup (internal or external)
until the inode is fully initialised.

IOWs, features that XFS has
supported for 25+ years (like open-by-handle) is supported natively
by the XFS inode cache and the XFS inode life cycle state machine.

In contrast, The way the VFS inode cache handles stuff like this is
very much a hacked-in "oops we didn't think of that" after-thought
that doesn't actually cover all the different APIs or filesystems...

I think that's going to be harder than it sounds (speaking as the
architect of the comprehensive on-disk metadata validation
infrastructure in XFS).

Yup, that would be useful.

> Note unlock_new_inode() and similar are not mandatory to call.

To a point. i.e. if you are using a VFS inode hash implemtation that
sets I_NEW, then it is definitely mandatory to call
unlock_new_inode().  Documentation/filesystems/porting.rst even says
that.

However, if you aren't using a VFS inode cache implemenation that
sets I_NEW, then you've got to set it yourself and clear it
appropriately so the rest of the VFS functionality does the right
thing whilst the inode is published but still being initialised.
e.g. putting an inode still undergoing initialisation on the
sb->s_inodes list without it being marked as I_NEW is, quite simply,
a bug.

Hence it may not be mandatory to use unlock_new_inode(), but if you
are publishing a partially initialised inode on any VFS list or
cache, you still need to be doing the right thing w.r.t. locking,
I_NEW, I_CREATING and calling unlock_new_inode() during inode
initialisation and cache lookups.

-Dave.
