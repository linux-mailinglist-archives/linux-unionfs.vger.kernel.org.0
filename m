Alex,

Pondering about this last sentence.

The overlay.verity xattr format is already in its 3rd revision since
the beginning of development.

When it was bare digest, it might have made sense to have no
header that describes the format.

When the algo byte was added, that was already a very big hint
that a proper header was in order.

Now that you had to change the meaning of the byte, it is very hard
to argue that the xattr format is guaranteed to be stable - in the sense
that it can never change again.

Please add a minimal header to the overlay.verity xattr format,
similar to ovl_fb, that will allow composefs/overlayfs to be
maintained as the separate projects that they are.

Something like this?

/* On-disk format for "verity" xattr */
struct ovl_verity {
        u8 version;     /* 0 */
        u8 len;          /* size of this header + size of digest */
        u8 flags;
        u8 algo;        /* digest algo */
        u8 digest[];
};

I realize that digest size may be inferred from xattr size,
but it is better to state the stored digest size explicitly and verify
that it matches expected xattr size.

Eric,

Does the digest buffer passed to fsnotify helpers have any
memory alignment requirements?

Thanks,
Amir.
