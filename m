Because it's wrong to advertise SB_POSIXACL support if the kernel
doesn't support it at all. It's a minor correctness thing. I'll provide
more details below.

When a filesystem doesn't raise SB_POSIXACL the vfs will strip the
umask. When a filesystem does raise SB_POSIXACL the vfs will not strip
the umask. Instead, the umask is stripped during posix_acl_create() in
the individual filesystems.

If the kernel doesn't support POSIX ACLs, i.e. CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL isn't
set then posix_acl_create() is a nop. Hence, on a kernel without
CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL any filesystem that raises SB_POSIXACL will not do
any umask stripping at all: not on the vfs level because the vfs sees
SB_POSIXACL and not on the filesystem level because posix_acl_create()
is a nop.

This complication in umask handling is a side-effect of POSIX ACLs and
one that is really nasty. But the general idea is that you can't get one
without the other. IOW, obviously no one should raise SB_POSIXACL if
they don't intend to support POSIX ACLs...

But as we all know, hackers like us gotta hack. So filesystems like NFS
do use SB_POSIXACL for exactly that. But life without nuanced
complications isn't worth living so NFS v3 and NFS v4 do it slightly
differently.

NFS v3 uses SB_POSIXACL to avoid umask stripping in the VFS but NFS v3
does optionally support POSIX ACLs

#ifdef CONFIG_NFS_V3_ACL
        .listxattr      = nfs3_listxattr,
        .get_inode_acl  = nfs3_get_acl,
        .set_acl        = nfs3_set_acl,
#endif

and so raising SB_POSIXACL makes sense in that case. But in all
likelihood NFS should conditionalize SB_POSIXACL for NFS v3 on
CONFIG_NFS_V3_ACL or - if they want to prevent umask stripping
completely - they also need to raise SB_I_NOUMASK. But I have zero idea
what's correct for them so I trust Jeff and other people interested in
NFS to figure out what they need.

NFS v4 on the other hand clearly doesn't care about POSIX ACL support at
all because they don't support it in any form. So NFS v4 is only
interested in the side-effects of POSIX ACLs on umask handling.

So for them SB_I_NOUMASK is clearly the right thing to do.

My reasoning about overlayfs is that it falls into the same category as
NFS v4 albeit for slightly different reasons. As a stacking filesystems
with a writable upper layer overlayfs can never rely on umask handling
done in the VFS because it doesn't (easily) know up front whether the
underlying filesystems supports POSIX ACLs or not.

And currently it always has to raise SB_POSIXACL to get the side-effects
on umask handling even if the kernel isn't compiled with POSIX ACL
support at all. IOW, you always want the upper layer to do the umask
handling.

So the correct thing to do is to raise SB_I_NOUMASK to communicate
clearly that umask handling will always be done by the upper layer. And
that in turn allows you to stop raising SB_POSIXACL unconditionally.

Because in fs/overlayfs/{inode.c,overlayfs.h} you can also see that all
ovl inode operations are nop-ed when CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL is turned off.

I'm not sure enough about FUSE and that would need separate patches.
