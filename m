It's consistent with the policy I've been following for years at this
point, regular SELinux (and audit) kernel contributors as well as
people who follow the related lists should be well aware of this by
now.  If you look at the SELinux kernel tree you'll find this
documented in the README.md file in the top level directory; here is
the relevant excerpt:

"Patches will be merged into the subsystem's next branch during the
development cycle which extends from merge window close up until the
merge window reopens. However, it is important to note that large,
complicated, or invasive patches sent late in the development cycle
may be deferred until the next cycle. As a general rule, only small
patches or critical fixes will be merged after -rc5/-rc6."

> Once it gets into a Release candidate we can push people to Rawhide to begin testing it.

As a reminder, once a patch hits the selinux/next branch it should
show up in my kernel-secnext builds within about an hour (+/- 30m
depending on the time and day).  Currently packages are only built for
Fedora Rawhide (source, x86_64, aarch64), but I still have aspirations
for providing Debian sid packages someday.
