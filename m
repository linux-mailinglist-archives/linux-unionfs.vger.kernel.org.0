Hi Vivek,

I remember you asked me about configuring extra mount options
for unionmount but couldn't find that conversation, so replying to this
related old discussion with my thoughts on the subject.

Now that unionmount supports the environment variables:
UNIONMOUNT_{BASEDIR,LOWERDIR,MNTPOINT}

And now that xfstests has helpers to convert xfstests env vars to
UNIONMOUNT_* env vars, one might ask: why won't we support
UNIONMOUNT_OPTIONS=$OVERLAY_MOUNT_OPTIONS

So when you asked me a question along those lines, my answer was that
unionmount performs different validations depending on the test options,
so for example, the test option ./run --meta adds the mount option
"metacopy=on", but it also performs different validation tests, such as
upper file st_blocks == 0 after metadata change.

Right, so I gave a reason for why supporting extra mount options is not
straight forward, but that doesn't mean that it is not possible.
unionmount test could very well parse the extra mount options passed
in env var and translate them to test config options.  As a matter of fact,
unionmount already parses the following overlay module parameters
and translates the following values to test config options:

1) redirect_dir does not exist => --xdev (expect EXDEV on dir rename)
2) redirect_dir exists and no explicit --xdev => add redirect_dir=on
3) index=N and --verify => add index=on and check st_ino validations
4) metacopy=Y => check --meta validations (e.g. upper st_blocks)
5) xino_auto=Y => add xino=on and check --xino validations (e.g. uniform st_dev)

So apart from blindly adding the extra mount options to mount command,
will also need to translate:

6) redirect_dir=off => --xdev
   (redirect_dir=on conflicts with --xdev)
7) index=off => overrides index=on added by --verify
   (st_ino validations should still pass on tests without multi layers)
8) metacopy=on => --meta
   (metacopy=off conflicts with --meta)
9) xino=auto/on => --xino
   (xino=off conflicts with --xino)

At the moment, I have a patch to xfstests [1] that implements rule 8 in the
xfstests _unionmount_testsuite_run helper, but I came to realize that would
be wrong and that the correct way would be to implement conversion rules
6-9 in unionmount itself and then blindly assign in xfstest helper:
UNIONMOUNT_OPTIONS=$OVL_BASE_MOUNT_OPTIONS

Does anyone spot any obvious flaws in this plan before I make those changes?

Thanks,
Amir.
