I guess the confusion is what defines a "test".

A specific xfstests test script (e.g. overlay/060) defines:
- requirements (run or skip)
- setup and operations to execute
- expectations

So when you pass extra mount options it might:
- cause test not to meet requirements and be skipped
- affect the setup/operations
- usually it does not change the expectations

But you can also define some global options like
USE_KMEMLEAK, TEST_XFS_REPAIR_REBUILD, TEST_XFS_SCRUB
which affect the validations that are run after each test
in *addition* to the specific expectations encoded in the test script.

A specific unionmount test (e.g. tests/rename-pop-dir.py) defines only:
- operations to execute
- expected return value

But the test engine performs extra validations after *each* operation
in addition to verifying the expected return value.

So when I write "verify st_blocks == 0 on upper", this is not an expectation
that is explicitly written in any specific test.
The test engine records the state of objects before and after each filesystem
operation is executed to know for each object if it is expected to be lower,
metacopy,upper and then it runs some validations after each operation
(like upper st_blocks) to verify that the actual state of the object matches the
expected state.

The test run option --xdev only is similar to the xfstests requirement
and it skips a few dir rename tests and changes expected return
value in others.

But the test run options --verify, --meta, --xino, --verify, are global test
options which determine what sort of validations are performed after
each and every operation in all the operations of all of the test cases.

Those checks are implemented in context.py functions:
check_dev_ino(), check_copy_up(), check_layer()

Is my explanation more clear now?
It is clear why unionmount needs to parse mount options in order
to set the expectations from validators?

If that is clear, please review my proposal to see if I missed anything.

Thanks,
Amir.
