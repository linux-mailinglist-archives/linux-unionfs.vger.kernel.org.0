Hi,
most likely this is not the right place to ask, please redirect me as needed.

I'm trying to use OverlayFS to add (limited) write capability to a ReadOnly
rootfs (SquashFS)

Essentially (actual script is more complex, of course) boot-sequence includes:

# /dev/mmcblk0p5: ext4 (upper+work+nwwroot+newroot/oldroot)
# /dev/mmcblk0p6: SquashFS mounted on /
mount /dev/mmcblk0p5 /overlay
mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/,upperdir=/overlay/upper,workdir=/overlay/workÂ  /overlay/newroot
cd /overlay/newroot
pivot_root . oldroot
mount --move oldroot/dev /dev
mount --move oldroot/proc /proc

This works as expected, but, too often for comfort, some file
(and sometime also directories) become unavailable due to error:

overlayfs: invalid origin (ssh/sshd_config, ftype=8000, origin ftype=4000).

File name changes, of course, but rest is fairly constant.

This always happens when some file is written.
Error persists reboots.
Only way I found to "cure" the system is to go on "upper" and delete the file
thus going back to "lower" version (in this case I should delete "/oldroot/overlay/upper/etc/ssh/sshd_config")

This is a self-built kernel (Linux vocore 5.7.0 #2 PREEMPT Mon Aug 3 09:19:06 CEST 2020 mips GNU/Linux)
on a custom target based on a SoC (MT7628).

I am available to do any required test, but I have no idea about where to start.

Any hint (or redirect) would be greatly appreciated.

Many Thanks in Advance
Mauro
