So this works only if inode has not been evicted. That means sometimes
it will work and other times it will error out. If that's the case
user has to write code to deal with the error anyway and does not
make life simpler.

Mayh be sync=fs was middle ground option where we ignore fsync() but still
do filesystem sync. And there we will do a sync of upper on umount and
then can remote this incompat directory.
