No again, it's just a bug.
My fix to initialize __lastmerged for root dentry broke initialization
of __lastmerged
for lookup of non-root dentry and readdir would fixup  __lastmerged later.

Pushed a fix. Again, only sanity tested, so the finalize feature may
still have bugs.

That's a good question - I don't know.
We can either try to see if someone shouts or add it as an opt-in feature.
I kind of dislike the idea of adding an opt-in option for this behavior,
which is explicitly documented as undefined and could lead to several
other weird issues, so I hope we can get away without opt-in.

Even if we agreed to extend the defined behavior to changes to lower
layers to objects which overlayfs did not yet observe, this definition will
not have included the case where the merged directory was already iterated.

Thanks,
Amir.
