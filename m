Nice use case.
It may be a niche use case the way to describe it, but the general concept
of "updatable software" at the lower layer is not unique to your use case.
See this [1] recent example that spawned the thread about updating the
documentation w.r.t changing underlying layers.

That's what I figured.

I wouldn't say it is "problematic" to implement. It is simple to convert the
EIO to warning (with opt-in option). What would be a challenge to implement
is the behavior, where metadata access is allowed for broken metacopy,
but data access results in EIO.

Yes, disabling metacopy and redirect_dir sounds like the right thing to do,
because I don't think they gain you too much anyway.

I know about overlayfs-tools's "merge" command.
I do not know if anyone is using this tool besides perhaps it's author (?).
Incidentally, I recently implemented the "deref" command for overlayfs-tools [2]
which unfolds metacopy and redirect_dir and creates an upper layer without
them. The resulting layer can then be deduped with lower layer using the
"merge" command.

[2] https://github.com/kmxz/overlayfs-tools/pull/11

I also implemented (in the same pull request) awareness of overlayfs-tools
to metacopy and redirect_dir with existing commands. "merge" command
simply aborts when they are encountered, but "vacuum" and "diff" commands
work correctly. I also added the "overlay diff -b" variant, which
creates an output
equivalent to that of the standard diff tool (diffutils) just by
analyzing the layers.

Thanks,
Amir.
