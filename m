Hi Amir,

/me does not understand well the notion of disconnected dentries and
 how nfs export stuff works. So please bear with my stupid questions.

I am wondering why a lower inode can't be metacopy inode. For the
normal lookup case, we can lookup in all lower layers and figure out
which is actual data inode and which inodes are metacopy inodes. 

For the case of disconnected dentry, we probably can't do lookup. So
are calling underlying filesystem to decode. (Using origin?). If yes,
will intermediate lower not have origin xattr which we can use
to follow the complete lower chain and reconstruct all real lower
dentries and use lower data dentry and latest lower meatacopy dentry
(in the same way we do as for lookup).

Thanks
Vivek
