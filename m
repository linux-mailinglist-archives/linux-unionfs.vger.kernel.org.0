umount does a sync normally and with "volatile" overlayfs skips that
sync. So a successful unmount does not mean that file got synced
to backing store. It is possible, after umount, system crashed
and after reboot, user tried to mount upper which is corrupted
now and overlay will not detect it.

You seem to be asking for an alternate option where we disable
fsync() but not syncfs. In that case sync on umount will still
be done. And that means a successful umount should mean upper
is fine and it could automatically remove incomapt dir upon
umount.

Intial version of patches had both the volatile modes implemented.
Later we dropped one because it was not clear who wants this
second mode. If this is something which is useful for you, it
can possibly be introduced.

Thanks
