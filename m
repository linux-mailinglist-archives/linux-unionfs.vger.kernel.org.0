I dunno. Each time I look at the xattr codepaths they seem very long,
and there is no vfs-side caching. Each getxattr() will invoke the
entire stack of reading and (re)parsing the metadata blocks needed for
xattr info. However, cpus are fast, and typically the blocks
themselves are cached in the buffer cache, so maybe this doesn't
necessarily matter.

To check this I ran some quick performance tests. A single, cached
(i.e. repeated), missed (e.g. ENODATA) getxattr call on xfs and ext4
takes about 1-1.5 microseconds. This is about the same timescale as a
stat call, so pretty fast I guess (and probably even faster when the
kernel does it, as there is no syscall overhead). However, on e.g. a
fuse mount (I used the passthrough_ll example) it takes about 20 usec
because each call must be roundtripped via the fuse daemon. Similarly
I can imagine a network filesystem may be slow here, although I see
that NFS4 has an xattr cache.

So, I guess the end result is that it's probably ok to use an extra
getxattr here, and that fuse should probably grow an xattr cache.
