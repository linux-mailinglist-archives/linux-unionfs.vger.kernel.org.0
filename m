When usespace calls mmap syscall, the call trace is as follows:

do_mmap
   __get_unmapped_area
   mmap_region
     mmap_file
       ovl_mmap

__get_unmapped_area() gets the address to mmap at, the file here is an overlayfs file.
Since ovl_file_operations doesn't defines get_unmapped_area callback, __get_unmapped_area()
fallbacks to mm_get_unmapped_area_vmflags(), and it doesn't return an address aligned to
large folio size.
