I refer to other file operations in overlayfs (i.e., ovl_fallocate, backing_file_mmap).
Since get_unmapped_area() has security related operations (e.g., security_mmap_addr()),
We should call it with the cred of the underlying file.

But the underlying file system may not support large folio. In this case,
the mmap address doesn't need to be aligned with THP size.
