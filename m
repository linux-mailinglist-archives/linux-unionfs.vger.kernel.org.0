Just in case my comment about documentation wasn't clear:

+When overlay is mounted with "volatile" option, overlay creates an internal
+directory "$workdir/work/incompat/volatile". During next mount, overlay
+checks for this directory and refuses to mount if present. This is a strong
+indicator that user should throw away upper and work directories and
+create fresh one. In very limited cases where user knows system has not
+crashed and contents in upperdir are intact, one can remove the "volatile"
+directory and retry mount.

Thanks,
Amir.
