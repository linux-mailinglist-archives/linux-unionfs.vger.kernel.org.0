Marco, did you actually *need* to use the case insensitive feature?
It is not turned on by default by e2fsprogs, and the assumption was
that it only be turned in cases where it was needed --- e.g., VM's
running Steam games that need Microsoft file system semantics,
including case insensitivity, Samba (and eventually NFSv4) file
servers for the same reason, and Android (so people won't have to try
to get the abomination known as sdcardfs upstream :-).

So I didn't think this would be that common, since you can certainly
run Sambda without this new file system feature --- Samba has lived
without it for over a decade.  However, if you are running a high
performance file server, it matters --- but if you're running a high
performance file server, you're certainly not going to be trying to do
it on the same server as one running Docker.

Now, if you're trying to use overlayfs for some kind of snapshot
application, then we'll need to figure out how to make overlayfs and
ext4 work together --- but I view this as much more over an overlay
compatibility issue than an ext4 bug.

We *might* be able to only set the dentry functions on directory
entries belonging to directories which have the casefold flag set,
instead of simply setting it on all ext4 dentry entries.  But still
won't change the fact that overlayfs is going to have case
insensitivity support if we want the combination of overlayfs &&
casefold to be supported.

That's correct, it's still on the todo list.

Nope.  I didn't think that was going to be a common use case.  Docker
is typically used on servers, where as case insensitivity is important
for clients and file servers --- at least on the general case.

It wouldn't be that hard to test overlayfs with ext4 for my
pre-release testing.  But it would only be in the default ext4
configuration --- and that doesn't include the case fold feature.
