Hi Amir,

Thanks for the explanation. I understand your perspective little
better now.

But why do we have to enable these st_blocks checks after the test if
user asked to be mounted with "metacopy=on". 

IOW, if user wants to run these additional st_blocks checks, that
should be drive by explicit option "--meta" to _unionmount_testsuite_run.

Enabling "--meta" implicitly probably does not hurt now given what
"--meta" is doing but some other option "--foo" might be doing much
more (including running additional tests) and mapping that becomes
very tricky and kind of unexpected.

So how about we keep it simple. That is we don't try to map mount
options to associated arguments to unionmount testsuite. We probably
just need to detect conflicts and then skip test? For example, if
I run "_unionmount_testsuite_run --ov --meta" and also specifcy
"metacopy=off", then its a conflict and probably need to either
skip this test or error out and point towards the conflict etc.

If I pass mount option "metacopy=on" I don't expect unionmount
testsuite to suddenly start verifying that on upper layer st_blocks==0.
That I will expect from a specific test or if I call
"_unionmount_testsuite_run --ov --meta". This is not necessarily
similar to generally xfs options you mentioned for additional
verification, because unionmount testsuite options are generic
and one can implement anything behind these options (and are not
limited to additional verification only).

I don't have too detailed understanding of design of both testsuites.
So all my thoughts are from a pure user perspective. 

Thanks
Vivek
