That's true.
I see that at least ext4_sync_file() and ext4_do_writepages()
test the EXT4_MF_FS_ABORTED case specifically to return EROFS.

Yeh, I think that makes a lot of sense.

What I meant is, except from emergency remount rdonly and fs specific
cases like ext4 remount-ro on error, is there a way via new mount API
that users can request remount of the upper SB rdonly, despite the
fact that this sb has private writable mount clones?
even if ovl has elevated mnt_writers of upper_mnt?

Thanks,
Amir.
