I'm not sure that will work.  libmount will just remove the \072
escaping from the whole lowerdir=3D option and we'll be left with the
the unescaped sequence.   I think it's better to add the old "\:"
escaping in case it was not added originally.

Right.

Yes, it's like a network stack with various levels of encoding and
decoding.  The escaping on the mountinfo level is there so that fields
and options can properly be separated.   The escaping on the old mount
API had a similar purpose but using a different encoding.   Shouldn't
we make this consistent, so that only one level of escaping is done
and at the right level?

No.  What I mean by redundant is that a layer named "x,y" is encoded
as e.g. upperdir=3Dx\,y when mounting on the old API.   Mountinfo it
will look like "upperdir=3Dx\134\054y".  The \134 is totally redundant
and not needed to separate the options, just remains there
historically from the input encoding.

If we are not strict about the encoding/decoding rules then something
can break anyway.

Agree double escaping being unncessary, not sure I agree about needing
to escape ':' on the mountinfo level.

See my above argument against escaping colons on the mountinfo level.
