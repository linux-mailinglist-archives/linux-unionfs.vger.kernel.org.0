Just to add a few more details here that seem to have fallen under
table.
This is only true for the application container world. LXD has supported
this feature for years and we run millions of container in production
including all non-x86 workloads on travis.
We've supported isolated idmaps since at least 2016 [1]. Here's a demo
of that feature too:

Again, this is only true for the application container world. LXD does
this automatically for you.

That's how we do it right now. Our range is 1 billion ids currently.
