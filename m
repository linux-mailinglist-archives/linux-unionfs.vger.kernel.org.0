I'm in a somewhat middle position.

Targets are embedded systems and it wouldn't make any sense
to implement a fully flexible update system (deb/rpm/ipkg/...);
I just have two "packages": system and application.

I *am* the "rootfs (aka: system) image provider".

OTOH I'm not responsible for the zillions packages composing a RootFS.
A vast majority of packages provides "default configurations", often
completely commented-out and heavily commented "for reference".
I don't think it would be a good idea to inspect each and all the
packages to remove such "useless" files.

In some instances such configuration I need to override "globally"
(i.e.: for all targets in the same manner) and that's easy because
I can override in generated RootFS (lower SquashFS).

In other instances changes need to be done on a per-target
basis (note: I have ~20k targets to handle in places I cannot
physically reach after installation... I mean: i *can* reach, but it
would be expensive, you don't want to do it if net is still up).

Here I have two cases:
There are "once in the life" configurations that could conceivably
be done at a central point (e.g.: client certificates), but that would
mean to send different update images to each target, a logistic
nightmare.
There are other configs that need to be done at installation
and possibly changed later (e.g.: WiFI setup).
In both cases configurations *must* survive a full upgrade.

Bottom line:
I *need* to be able to change "lower" keeping "upper", otherwise
OverlayFS is simply not the right tool for me.
Alternative would be to save all configs somewhere and
restore them after an update, which is highly "inconvenient"
for many reasons, especially in system that may (and will!!)
need to be updated in unforeseeable ways.
Please do *not* enforce cleanup of "upper" on "lower" changes.
