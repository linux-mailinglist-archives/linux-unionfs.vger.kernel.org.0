Yeah, the documentation as part of the patch really just describes the
new options as they relate to how the kernel uses and produces these
new xattrs. I.e. as if you're using the new verity support only as a
way to make the meta-copy-up feature more robust by having the copy-up
operation record the digest of the source.

The way composefs uses the various features of overlayfs (metacopy,
redirect, verity, read-only-image) to combine into the "composefs"
feature isn't really described

To be more specific, it is a sparse file in any layer other than the
lowermost lowerdir that has the "overlay.metacopy" xattr set. When
this file is accessed from the overlay mount, all the metadata is
taken from the file, but the content is taken from the similarly named
file in a lower layer.

In addition, an overlay.redirect xattr can be set on the file. This
allows specifying a separate filename for the content file in the
lower layer.
