overlay readdir of merged dir NEEDS to merge lower entries
that DO NOT exist in the upper layer - if there are not such entries
found, looking in the lower layer next time is futile.

The lower layer still has information that overlayfs needs,
and ovetrlayfs needs to be able to follow redirects into lower layer.
This is not going to work with an opaque upper dir.

Maybe, or use the combination of "opaque" + "redirect" to
describe this hybrid type of directory (the dir content was fully
copied up, but redirects may still follow to lower entries.
Essentially, this is equivalent to a lower-most directory (implicitly
opaque dir) that can follow redirects into a data-only layer.

No. A directory inode is a sort of a file whose "data" is the dir content.
"copy-up completeness" means the list of entries have been copied up
(not recursively).

> completely copied up?

readdir operated on a single dir inode.
readdir of a directory can end up making it "half-opaque"
nothing recursive about it - application can do this recursively
as it wishes.

Not doing anything recursive.

Not really. The patch is not trivial, but the concept is simple.
If I find a few hours, I will post a demo.

That sounds much better than mangling with overlayfs xattrs.

Confused. I thought you were going to use the patch for offline preparation
of metacopy layers.

Note that once you did mv into an opaque tree,
you can move the opaque dir back into its original location
(e.g. /blah/think/UUID...) and the dir will remain opaque,
because EXDEV is only generated when trying to move
merged dirs.
Moving opaque upper dirs around is allowed and should work.

Thanks,
Amir.
