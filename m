This is on my todo list. My current plan is to grab the creds that the
daemon uses to respond to FUSE_INIT. That should keep behavior fairly
similar. I'm not sure if there are cases where the fuse server is
operating under multiple contexts.
I don't currently have a plan for exposing open files via lsof. Every
such file should relate to one that will show up though. I haven't dug
into how that's set up, but I'm open to suggestions.

Our main concern with it is performance. We have some preliminary
numbers looking at the pure passthrough case. We've been testing using
a ramdrive on a somewhat slow machine, as that should highlight
differences more. We ran fio for sequential reads, and random
read/write. For sequential reads, we were seeing libfuse's
passthrough_hp take about a 50% hit, with fuse-bpf not being
detectably slower. For random read/write, we were seeing a roughly 90%
drop in performance from passthrough_hp, while fuse-bpf has about a 7%
drop in read and write speed. When we use a bpf that traces every
opcode, that performance hit increases to a roughly 1% drop in
sequential read performance, and a 20% drop in both read and write
performance for random read/write. We plan to make more complex bpf
examples, with fuse daemon equivalents to compare against.

We have not looked closely at the impact of individual opcodes yet.

There's also a potential ease of use for fuse-bpf. If you're
implementing a fuse daemon that is largely mirroring a backing
filesystem, you only need to write code for the differences in
behavior. For instance, say you want to remove image metadata like
location. You could give bpf information on what range of data is
metadata, and zero out that section without having to handle any other
operations.
