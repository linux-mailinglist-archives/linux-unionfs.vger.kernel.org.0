Can we read and store "/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id". I am assuming
this will change if system is rebooting after a shutdown/reboot/crash.

If boot_id has not changed, we can allow remount and delete incomapt
dir ourseleves. May be we can drop a file in incomat to store boot_id
at the time of overlay mount.

Thanks
