Edouard,

I am sorry to be discouraging, but I personally don't see much value
in this rephrasing
and I also don't think that the current documentation is lacking in this po=
int.
This is my personal opinion and review is a community procedure.
If there are proponents for this rewrite let them speak up.

Sorry. This feels out of scope to me.
I think the introduction sections describe overlayfs and lower and
upper layers well enough.

Sorry, but I am not sure if those details belong in the scope of this docum=
ent,
because I don't think we would like to commit to any specific procedure of
cleaning the upper layer.

I do hear your concerns as a user, but I don't think that better documentat=
ion
alone is going to solve them.

What overlayfs has always been missing is a counterpart library and user to=
ols
to deal with those things.

There has been an attempt in the past to start overlayfs-progs [1] and late=
r
overlayfs-tool2 project [2] to work on offline overlayfs layers.
I even contributed the "overlay deref" command [3] which partly does what
you are looking for, but it does not look like this project is
actively developed
except for a recent merge of the fsck tool from overlayfs-progs.

Thanks,
Amir.
