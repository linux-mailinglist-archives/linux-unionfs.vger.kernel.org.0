Why should parent_file open with O_RDONLY flag? Meanwhile, I think the=20
fix is not sufifcient for fully supporting 'dirsync' or 'sync' in overlayfs=
.
Anyway, I think the description of expected behavior above makes sense=20
so maybe the topic should turn to implement 'sync' or 'dirsync' mount
options or reject specifying those options in overlayfs.
