I can reproduce the bolt testcase problem in a podman container, with
overlay driver, using ext4, xfs, and btrfs. So I think I can drop
linux-btrfs@ from this thread.

Also I can reproduce the title of this thread simply by 'podman system
reset' and see the kernel messages before doing the actual reset. I
have a strace here of what it's doing:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L9lEm5n4-d9qemgCq3ijqoBstM-PP1By/view?usp=sharing

It may be something intentional. The failing testcase,
:../tests/test-common.c:1413:test_io_dir_is_empty also has more
instances of this line, but I don't know they are related. So I'll
keep looking into that.

I'll work with bolt upstream and try to further narrow down when it is
and isn't happening.

I'm not sure. It could be podman specific or fuse-overlayfs related.
Maybe something is using /tmp in one case and not another for some
reason?

Yep. I think tmpfs supports xattr but not user xattr? And this example
is rootless podman, so it's all unprivileged.

Yep. All good ideas. Thanks for the fast reply. I'll report back once
this has been narrowed down futher.
