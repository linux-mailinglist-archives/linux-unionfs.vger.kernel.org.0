Dear Amir,

We actively discussed about patches with Pavel, so with your favour I'll try to answer (partially) to some of your comments.

Yes, it's just as example of existing inconsistency between mount-time/show-time
options. But yes, errno will be different. As it was said before we can simply
ignore new options at mount time.

At current moment this options only affect on show options, but of course, we
can change patch, so that if both new features are turned off, we not hold
"struct path" reference. In this case behavior will fully as it was before proposed
changes.

If user know that overmounts is not used on lowerdir/workdir/upperdir paths,
then it's not required to know mnt_id. Full path seems to be sufficient in this
scenario. It's not a critical for CRIU needs to have one or two options.

As far as I know documentation patches must be send to another mailing list.
Of course I have plan to add information to overlayfs documentation about new feature.

No, CRIU simply checkpoints *all* mounts in all mount namespaces
of process inside container, but if user (the one who calls criu,
e.g. container manager) want to use some mount from external mount
namespace then user must specify this mounts explicitly on restore
and we simply make bindmount (from this external mount) in
internal mount namespace.

Huh, seems very interesting! Thanks! I will need to dive into fhandle's
system to fully understand how it works.

Requirements is very simple, at "dump stage" we need to save all overlayfs mount options
sufficient to fully reconstruct overlayfs mount state on "restore stage". We already
have proof of concept implementation of Docker overlayfs mounts when docker is running in
OpenVZ container. In this case we fully dump all tree of mounts and all mount namespaces.
CRIU mounts restore procedure at first reconstruct mount tree in special separate subtrees
called "yards", then when all mounts is reconstructed we do "pivot_root" syscall. And
with overlayfs it was a problem, because we mounted overlayfs with lowerdir,workdir,upperdir
paths with mount namespace "yard" path prefix, and after restore in mount options user may see
that lowerdir,workdir,upperdir paths were changed... It's a problem. Also it makes second C/R
procedure is impossible, because after first C/R lowerdir,workdir,upperdir paths is invalidated
after pivot_root.

Example for Docker (after first C/R procedure):

options lowerdir=/tmp/.criu.mntns.owMo9C/9-0000000000//var/lib/docker/overlay2/l/4BLZ4WH6GZIVKJE5QF62QUUKVZ:/var/lib/docker/overlay2/l/7FYRGAXT35JMKTXCHDNCQO3HKT,upperdir=/tmp/.criu.mntns.owMo9C/9-0000000000//var/lib/docker/overlay2/30aa26fb5e5671fc0126f2fc0e84cc740ce6bf06ca6ad4ac877a3c60f5aceaf1/diff,workdir=/tmp/.criu.mntns.owMo9C/9-0000000000//var/lib/docker/overlay2/30aa26fb5e5671fc0126f2fc0e84cc740ce6bf06ca6ad4ac877a3c60f5aceaf1/work

/tmp/.criu.mntns.owMo9C/9-0000000000/ is a root yard for corresponding mount namespace. It's
service only temporary directory. After pivot_root this path is inaccessible and irrelevant.

To fix this problem 1st patch was prepared. To solve problem of C/Ring possible overmounts we
suggest 2nd patch with mnt_id showing.

At the moment we don't support loop-devices C/R. But yes, we may be will need to patch
ioctl(LOOP_GET_STATUS) for C/R needs.
