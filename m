Although I also think it might be inappropriate to document the whole
mkfs.composefs tool in overlayfs.rst, I'm not sure if it could be helpful
to document (or mention) some other typical attractive use cases other than
the primary one ("present a filesystem which redirects writes to the upper
layer?") so people could easily find/use/develop such additional use cases
as well?

That could be in a seperate work though.

Thanks,
