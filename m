It might actually be fairly likely, considering that whenever a system includes
a choice of cryptographic algorithm, it tends to grow to include many different
algorithms.  Some of the reasons for this include:

  - Algorithms can become outdated and broken, yet systems often have to
    continue to support such algorithms for backwards compatibility.

  - People sometimes insist on using "national pride" algorithms, e.g. due to
    government regulations.  For example, in China people can be required to use
    Chinese algorithms instead of the U.S. / NIST algorithms.  See e.g. the
    existing support for SM3, SM4, Streebog, and Aria in the kernel crypto API
    and various other kernel subsystems.

  - Non-cryptographic algorithms might be added for use cases that don't
    actually require cryptographic security, e.g. integrity-only.

I'd strongly discourage you from building something whose security critically
depends on every algorithm that may ever exist being cryptographically secure.

Also, two hash algorithms that are each secure individually are not necessarily
secure when used as alternatives sharing the same output space.  E.g. consider
algorithm1 = SHA-256(data) and algorithm2 = SHA-256(data with all bits flipped).

Just store the algorithm alongside the digest.  It's just 1 extra byte.
