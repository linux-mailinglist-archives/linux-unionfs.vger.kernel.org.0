This response is mostly about composefs and as Alex wrote
these details have no place in overlayfs.rst and not related to the
proposed feature, which stands alone even without composefs.

I never considered that overlayfs.rst is for an audience other than
overlayfs developers or people that want to become overlayfs
developers. It is not a user guide. If it were, it would have been a
very bad one.

Yeh, that's a valid point.
That is what I wanted to know - what exactly is missing.
I guess this is the documented motivation:

"This may then be used to verify the content of the source file at the time
the file is opened"

but it does not tell a complete chain of trust story.

How about something along the lines of:

"In the case that the upper layer can be trusted not to be tampered
with while overlayfs is offline and some of the lower layers cannot
be trusted not to be tampered with, the "verity" feature can protect
against offline modification to lower files, whose metadata has been
copied up to the upper layer (a.k.a "metacopy" files) ...."

It's generic language that what the patches do, regardless of the
trust model of composefs and how it composes an overlayfs layers.

I am not a native English speaker and bad at documentation in general,
so the only thing I can say is the passive-aggressive "patches welcome" ;-)

Thanks,
