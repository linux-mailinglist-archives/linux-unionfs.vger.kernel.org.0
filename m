From here below the NFS export story is my own blurb.
I admit is it hard to understand.
I do not consider myself a very good technical writer...

It is the first one, as written: "Offline changes, *when the overlay
is not mounted*,..."

The meaning is that making changes offline to the lower layers while
the overlay is not mounted, will cause undefined behavior after mounting
the overlay with those lower layers again.

Yes, those xattrs refer to the information observed in the lower layer
during copy up.
If you, for example, delete and recreate a file/dir of the same name in low=
er
layer while overlayfs was offline, then after overlayfs is online
again, you may not
be able to access the re-created lower file/dir.

Feel free to suggest a different phrasing based on your understand.

Submitting a patch to Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.rst is the
preferred format, but if you like to propose a text here that is fine too.

Thanks,
Amir.
