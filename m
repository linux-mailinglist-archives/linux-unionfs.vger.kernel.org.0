Which one?
IIRC, you had two requests.
One very broad to get the overlayfs.rst document up-to-date:
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/20230514190903.GC9528@sol.localdo=
main/

But I assume you mean the specific request about this sentence:
[2] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/20230514192227.GE9528@sol.localdo=
main/

I must say, I re-read this paragraph and the email thread and I don't
understand what it is that you are asking for.

I am not trying to dismiss your request, I am trying to understand.
I understand that overlayfs.rst is not a high standard spec and that
"metacopy files" is not well defined and I am not saying that we cannot
improve the documentation.

But since you already spent the extra time understanding the inaccuracies
of overlayfs.rst during v2 review and we already tried to explain the
details of metacopy in v2 review, please elaborate what information
is actually missing that made the review of v3 harder for you, so
that we can try to improve those parts.

Let me try to tell this story in a different way

Imagine a feature:
   send/recv email attachments by reference
   instead of attaching files, drop them in a network share
   and send/recv a URL to that share with optional verity sig.
verity=3Doff:
   do not include verity sig when sending emails
   do not verify verity sig when receiving emails
verity=3Don:
   include verity sig when sending emails (if available)
   verify verity sig if it is included in received email
verity=3Drequire:
   same as verity=3Don, but if verity sig is not included
   in received email, do not follow URL.
   if verity sig not available when sending, attach the
   file itself instead of the URL -
   that is what "otherwise a full copy-up" means in the
   context above

To me this sounds exactly like the documentation above.
Is this story clear?
If it is, what in the doc above is missing to make it also clear?

Thanks,
Amir.
