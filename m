I agree.  I like your approach.  Especially for ENOIOCTLCMD/ENOTTY.
Since ntfs-3g returns EINVAL, that seems necessary to avoid logspam
for now.  Do you think it would make sense for me to suggest returning
ENOIOCTLCMD to the ntfs-3g project?  It seems more appropriate and
consistent with other filesystems to me, but I'm certainly not an
expert:
https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/blob/2021.8.22/libntfs-3g/ioctl.c#L415
I didn't see any other errors from in-tree filesystems, but who knows
errors other FUSE projects may return.

Does that mean all copy-up operations would fail for an upper which
does not support file attributes, or only ones where the file being
copied has attributes set?  I'm a little concerned about debugability,
since the failure modes may not be obvious to users.  Although the log
warnings would help with that.

Would it be possible to refuse to mount an upper which doesn't support
file attrs over a lower which does?  At least the failure would be
immediate and obvious.  If a use case is found, perhaps a mount option
to control file attr behavior cold be added at that point?  Just
thinking out loud.

Works great for me.

Thanks for the fast investigation and fix!
