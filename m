This is intentional as the documentation commit clarifies.
You are allowed to re-create lower dir when not enabling
index or nfs_export which implies index=3Don.
You are not allowed to re-create lower dir when using new features.
Specifically, index and nfs_export features simply cannot work
with re-created lower. Read about this in overlay documentation.

When you copy lower layer, you need to re-create an empty upper dir
you cannot mount an old upper dir with new lowerdir when nfs_export is
enabled.
