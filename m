Some packages solved that problem by keeping system default
separate from user default files and over upgrade user files are
left untouched.

So basically squashfs image will be udpated. I am not sure how this
will work for all the cases. What if application is updated and
it decides to rename its config file from foo.txt to bar.txt. Now
when application is launched, user defaults are lost anyway.

IOW, what is rootfs image provider expecting. Are they expecting
overlayfs to be there and are they writing applications in backward
compatible manner. I don't generally boot into such systems so
I have no idea. 

Thanks
