Thanks for the hints.

Ok, marking impure makes sense as long as it's properly described.

Just tried to describe the background since the question I think
is not quite erofs-utils specific, btw, if there could be some
reference official offline tool, that would be great!

Yes, I know there is some overhead though, so I tend to add
some option to the merge tool called "--keep-whiteout=0" to
formally drop unneeded whiteouts in the end, and I think we
also need to clear unneeded origin xattrs later.  Jingbo once
would like to confirm the best way to describe such situation
to work out the merge tool.

Thanks for the reminder, we will check later (off work now..)
