You are right, I overlooked the case of dropping cache.

IIUC, the flags will still keep in overlayfs' inode after copy up until=20
the inode cleaned by dropping cache. So I think your suggestion will be
helpful for the case of meta-copyup & dropping cache.

Hi Miklos

Is it worth to change like above?

I think though ovl_ioctl_set_flags() triggers data copy up but the flags
will be set correctly to upper file, because chattr(1) will get the flags
first and set the whole flags(include original flags) to upper file.

Thanks,
Chengguang
