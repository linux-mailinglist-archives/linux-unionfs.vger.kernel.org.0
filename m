Marco reported the error on vfat and asked which other fs will have
similar issue.

The performance penalty for brute force in some worse cases is abysmal.
Most users don't know enough to blame the case insensitive compatibility
layer.

Ted, people are using docker for anything these days.
The chances that people won't use docker on the same machine
where ext4 case insensitive was enabled are slim.
It doesn't have to be high perf. server. It's enough that someone
reads an article about improving Samba with ext4 to set it up for
its home server.

Sure, but the complaints will start with "I enabled ext4 case insensitive
and docker stopped working..." the sooner we are ready for this the better.

Yep, that's what I had in mind. I know it wouldn't have caught
this specific issue.

Thanks,
