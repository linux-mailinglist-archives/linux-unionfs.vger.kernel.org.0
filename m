Thank you Amir
I tested the branch and check the -ENOENT is returned on open time in my use case.
And I have one more suggestion, it is would be better on upper file rename case to be covered as well.
The idea is pre query dentry hash on ovl_inode initialization time.
If it is acceptable, then consider to apply this idea.
here is my patch.

And this comment
Um, As I think, I don't know advantage of upperdir reachable (or writable)
So, I think hide of upperdir from user can make this situation does not happen.
And there is other way to make upperdir readable or semi hide state from user(as you say)
but it is not forcefully applied by overlayfs and user has a responsibility of doing that.
(many user does not care and know well this features)
I think hiding upperdir, making upperdir readable forcefully and any idea of blocking touchable
upperdir can make overlayfs happy. 

Than youk Amir :)
