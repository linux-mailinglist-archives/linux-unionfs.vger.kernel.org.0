So you will not like my solution in "[PATCH v11 2/5] fs: __vfs_getxattr 
nesting paradigm"sent out this morning; so adding the flag option and 
widespread touching of _all_ the filesystem xattr.c/acl.c/inode.c/etc 
files to the calls is probably the easiest to stomach with the lowest 
attack surface.

Any other ideas (with less impact to tons of API/ABI/filesystems) that 
we have not thought about before I spin a v12 patch set?
