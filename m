I don't know.

I am not sure what wasn't clear in my answer.

The lowerfs image, namely /run/image-rofs in your script can be downloaded
from tftp or from the web. I have no idea what actually happens in your setup.

Every time you run this init script this lower fs image may change, while the
upper f2fs rwfs does not change.
When that happens, it MAY cause the reported issue.

Thanks,
Amir.
