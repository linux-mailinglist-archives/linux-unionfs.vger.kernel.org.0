I am sorry, my POV is exactly the opposite of that.
No need to argue about it though ;-)

I started thinking about this because of the squashfs bug report
(replacing lower layers) for which I had sent a patch to automatically
disable non-dir origin.

Reproducing the same problems with underlying fs with uuid is harder
but not impossible to think of a scenario.
My line of thinking is why should force feed the users with a feature they
didn't ask for if it can break something.
The very least we could do is allow users to opt-out.

But then again, if no one complains, we don't really need to do anything.
I have that feature (no follow origin) anyway for snapshot, but I can enable
it only for the snapshot case, so I don't mind if it can be enabled with
another config option or not - just wanted to put it out there for discussion.

Thanks,
Amir.
