If we keep volatile inside workdir, then we fail work and upperdir
being separate subtree checks. And I suspect that all that trap
magic will trigger too.

I think for image building use case, tools to have access to volatile
directory. So that they can persist it, rename it and use it as lower
layer for next layer build. That means we will have to document it
and let users access and rename $workdir/work/incompat/volatile/ or
$workdir/work/volatile.

Once Miklos has suggested to drop a file in workdir say $workdir/volatile
And next remount will refuse to mount that overlay instance if
$workdir/volatile is present. With this approach work/ and upper/
are in separate dir subtrees.

And user will be forced to remove work/ and upper/ if previous instance
was mounted with "volatile".

I am not too worried about protection against older kernels because if
system has been setup to boot into a new kernel, it will boot into
new kernel again. (Until and unless somebody forces it to go back to
old kernel). But if you think providing protection against old kernels
is important, we could create volatile in $workdir/work/dir1/dir2/volatile
instead.

/me is wondering why I don't get error with $workdir/work/dir1/volatile
but I do with $workdir/work/dir1/dir2/volatile. IOW, why in first
case removal of dir1 was successful despite the fact it is non-empty.

Thanks
Vivek
