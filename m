This makes sense. I've been sure to cause the directory in the data-only
layer that subsequently experiences an "append" to be consulted to
lookup a different file before the append.

So I've gotten a test going that focuses on really just two behaviors
that would satisfy my use case and that seem to currently be true.
Tightening the claims to a few narrow -- and hopefully thus needing
little to no effort to support -- statements seems like a good idea to
me, though in thinking through my use case, the behaviors I attempt to
make defined are a little different from how I read the idea above. That
seems to be inclusive of regular lower layers, where files might or
might not be accessible through regular merge. It looks like your
finalize patch is more oriented towards establishing useful defined
behaviors in case of modifications to regular lower layers, as well as
general performance. I thought I could probably go even simpler.

Because I simply want to add new software versions to the big underlying
data-only filesystem periodically but am happy to create new overlayfs
mounts complete with new "middle"/"redirect" layers to the new versions,
I just focus on establishing the safety of append-only additions to a
data-only layer that's part of a mounted overlayfs.
The only real things I need defined are that appending a file to the
data-only layer does not create undefined behavior in the existing
overlayfs, and that the newly appended file is fully accessible for
iteration and lookup in a new overlayfs, regardless of the file access
patterns through any overlayfs that uses the data-only filesystem as a
data-only layer.

The defined behaviors are:
 * A file added to a data-only layer while mounted will not appear in
   the overlayfs via readdir or lookup, but it is safe for applications
   to attempt to do so.
 * A subsequently mounted overlayfs that includes redirects to the added
   files will be able to iterate and open the added files.

So the test is my attempt to create the least favorable conditions /
most likely conditions to break the defined behaviors. Of course testing
for "lack of undefined" behavior is open-ended in some sense. The test
conforms to the tightly defined write patterns, but since we don't
restrict the read patterns against overlayfs there might be other
interesting cases to validate there.

I suppose the eventual place for this would be the fstests mailing list
but I was hoping you might be able to comment on the viability of making
these defined first. I'm also definitely open to suggestions to
strengthen the test.

Many thanks,
Mike
