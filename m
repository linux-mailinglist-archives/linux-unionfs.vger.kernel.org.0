TBH, I have no strong tendency of this for now.  But the hidden layers
(just for redirection) might be useful if they're used for data provider
only and my potential concern might be too strict so that we lose the
later extendibility...

Yeah, that is what I'd like to mention for now, at least leave
some extendibility for option format...
