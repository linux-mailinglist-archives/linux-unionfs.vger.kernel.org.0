Don't be scared :-)
Your reaction is a good answer to Vivek's question above -
No, it is not fair to say don't re-create lower and use existing upper

But we may decide this is forbidden in case user opts-in to
new features. The mentioned fix commit fixes the regression
for mounts without mount options (index, xino, metacopy),
just like your use case.

Yes, it was fixed in v5.8.0 (and not in v5.9-rc1 as I wrote).

Thanks,
Amir.
