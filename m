We aren't working on this at the moment, but I did have some off-list discu=
ss discussion with Amir Goldstein. I wanted to include our correspondence o=
n this list for posterity --- e.g. us working on this later, someone else w=
orking on this later, etc., and he said that is fine, so here it is. It too=
k me a while to find the time splice together all the replies and their quo=
tes, but now I have it.=0A=
=0A=
One thing I'll add is that while I still think this "resetting" operation i=
s a good feature for overlay fs in general (and not just our use-case), the=
 FUSE passthrough work (from Android most recently, not yet merged AFIAK) w=
ould be an even better fit for our use-case than overlay fs. I don't know i=
f upstreaming that is still being pursued, but if it is, it seams reasonabl=
e to just wait for it. Indeed, FUSE passthrough ought to be a good replacem=
ent for the whole gamut of exotic bind/union/overlay mounting without out a=
dding endless more functionality and code to the kernel.=0A=
