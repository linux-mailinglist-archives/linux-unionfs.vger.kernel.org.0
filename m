Sure, but even if the document is just for kernel developers, it should still
describe motivation and use cases, as those are important for userstanding.

So *online* tampering of the upper layer is fine?

Data of lower files, not simply "lower files", right?

Are *online* modifications to lower files indeed not in scope?

If the feature "can protect", then under what circumstances does it protect, and
under what circumstances what does it not protect?

It would also be helpful to explain what specifically is meant by "protect".
Does it mean that overlayfs prevents modifications to lower file data, or does
it mean that overlayfs detects modifications to lower file data after they
happen?  If the latter, what happens when overlayfs detects a modification?
What do userspace programs experience?

It's better, but it could use some more detail.  See my comments above.
