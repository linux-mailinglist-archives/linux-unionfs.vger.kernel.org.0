I unfortunately missed this conversation. I wanted to bring up OverlayFS, and
ephemeral upper dirs. We use overlayfs with Docker containers, and we waste
a lot of time on writing things back to disk.

We're not so peeved about the fact that OVL does any sync operations, as that's
what our users have been used to. The big problem is on unmount, ovelfs decides
syncing the upperdirs is a good idea. IIRC, this regression was
introduced somewhere
in the 4.X series.

We've been carrying a patch to short-circuit this behaviour for a while now:
https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/linux/commit/edb195d9b73cc22d095078010a14a690f41ee253

I know that this behaviour (and any behaviour that short-circuits
O_SYNC / FUA is
technically "wrong", but in this case, can we make an exception? I originally
thought about using device mapper to remove the FUA bit from all BIOs, but it
turns out that my underlying storage *always* persists data to disk,
so every write
takes...a long time.

Amir, what's your take?
