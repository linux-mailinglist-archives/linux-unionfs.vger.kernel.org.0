This is not the first time this sort of suggestion has been made:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/4bc73729-5d85-36b7-0768-ae5952ae05e9@mykernel.net/T/#md5fc5d51852016da7e042f5d9e5ef7a6d21ea822

At the time, I proposed to use the SHUTDOWN ioctl as a means
for containers runtime to communicate careless teardown.

I've pushed an uptodate version of ovl-shutdown RFC [1].
It is only lightly tested.
It does not take care of OVL_SHUTDOWN_FLAGS_NOSYNC, but this
is trivial. I also think it misses some smp_mb__after_atomic() for
accessing ofs->goingdown and ofs->creator_cred.
I did not address my own comments on the API [2].
And there are no tests at all.

If this works for your use case, let me know how you want to proceed.
I could re-post the ioctl and access hook patches, leaving out the actual
shutdown patch for you to work on.
You may add some of your own patched, write tests and post v2.

Thanks,
Amir.
