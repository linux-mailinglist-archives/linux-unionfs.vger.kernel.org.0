I think your complaint is mostly related to the scope/goal of the
overlayfs.rst file. The way it is currently written, and how the patch
adds to it, it describes purely how overlayfs works "natively".

For example, when you change just the permissions of a file from the
lower layer, then overlayfs generates a metacopy file with some
special xattrs in the upper dir (rather than a full copy). It can also
do things like set a redirect xattr on the metacopy file if the file
changes name in the upper (due to a rename for example).

With the patch it may (depending on options) also set a verity xattr
on the metacopy file so that later uses of the upper layer can ensure
that the lower layer content file hasn't changed. This allows you to
improve the robustness of overlayfs layers, such that if at a later
time the lower directories accidentally change we will detect this
when using the metacopy file rather than delivering the wrong data.

These kinds of uses are completely standalone, you just mount overlay
with the right options and the kernel will do the right thing. There
is no need to know the internal details of the xattrs.

The problem is that I also have a different usecase with composefs.
This involves a completely different way of using overlayfs where you
construct manually a filesystem with the xattrs that overlayfs reads,
and then you mount this in a very special way (using a read-only
filesystem on loopback). A combination of overlayfs features will give
certain properties that are useful.

I feel like you expect that the overlayfs.rst document should describe
the details of the composefs setup, but instead it (both the patch and
the existing document) mainly describes the other kind of use.

In other words, if you are interested in using overlayfs with verity
to increase the robustness against layer changes, then the document is
probably enough. However, If you're interested in using overlayfs to
implement more complex features like composefs, then the document is
very weak in all sorts of details, not limited to the fs-verity part.

So, I don't think the current document is bad for what it does. But it
should perhaps be amended with a more detailed description of the
internals of the xattrs and their behaviour so that advanced users
(i.e. developers) don't have to read the source code for such details.
That seems like a general critique though, and not necessarily related
to this particular patchset.

> Side note: the use of the passive voice, e.g. "the xattr may be set" and =
"the
xattr may then be used to verify", should be avoided since it makes it uncl=
ear
who/what is doing these actions.

I'm not a native english speaker so I'm sure this can be written in a
better way, but when it says:

  When metadata copy up is used for a file, then the xattr
"trusted.overlay.verity" may be set on the metacopy file.

It really means:

  In certain circumstances, depending on mount options and other
details, it may be the case that when a metacopy file is being created
by overlayfs (as a side effect of a filesystem operation) the xattr
"trusted.overlay.verity" will be set on the new metacopy file.

So, this is not really using "may" in the passive voice, but I see
that it can be read that way.  I'll try to reword this in a way that
is more precise.
