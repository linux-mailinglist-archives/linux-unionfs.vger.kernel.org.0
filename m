Yea, I need to check out EROFS at some point. But many of our desktop
kernels are just too old atm.

Overall the idea of hand crafting metadata-only overlays is compelling
because you can avoid the complexity (and confusion) of using symlinks
and it's extremely lightweight (maybe even more so with EROFS).

Well, fscache is for caching the data contained in (existing) files
only right? It makes no attempt to deal with the metadata (e.g.
directories)?

Or at least I don't know how effective a disk based cache of metadata
could be compared to the vfs page cache when you still need to
revalidate fairly often. I mean it needs to revalidate the file often
(actimeo?) before it can serve the cached copy so it needs the remote
metadata lookups?

I have seen some talk (David Howells) about giving network filesystems
like NFS the ability to have "disconnected" access via netfs/fscache
(ala AFS) but I don't know if that is still on the cards.

The issue we see is that not only do our batch systems cycle through
lots of different software versions per hour, but we have many
thousands of clients doing the same to a single (Netapp) software
volume. Even if each NFS client managed to cache 80% of the negative
lookups between runs, the 20% that hits the Netapp is still quite
significant from many clients.

And even forgiving the server load implications, a Netapp on the LAN
(0.2ms) can add delay when you deal with many "pointless" negative
lookups. I have seen some of our software do 100,000 negative lookups
across 250 lib dirs, which although on paper should only be 100000 *
0.2ms = 20 seconds, actually adds almost a minute to the startup time
of the software. Certainly when we use a local filesytem overlay the
time drops by a minute anyway (most likely because the actual file
opens benefit too). Now if the software only runs for 2 minutes, then
1/3 of its time is spent doing negative lookups/path walking at
startup.

Yes, I am aware that our software is not well optimised but our build
system and environment is what it is at this point.

I have seen many other novel solutions to this general problem - some examples:

In my experience actimeo>3600 can help for these kinds of read-only
filesystems but you probably need "nocto" to really get it down to
almost no repeat network traffic at all (when cached). Setting
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=1 might also help keep the nfs inode data in
memory longer too?

But nocto will also cache the "ls -l" case whereby you won't see new
entries. However, if you know a new dir/file is there and access it,
it will do the new lookup and find it (dirent not in cache yet). That
might work for your case by the sounds of it?

I'm not too sure about how that effects opens specifically though. In
fact, using NFSv3 might be more "relaxed" in this regard than NFSv4?

In general, our entire pipeline deals with unique versioned files.
Apart from home directories, I can't think of many places where we
overwrite or append to existing files for production workloads or
reuse file paths in any way.

Yea, I think it is probably fine. Maybe another clarification for the
docs that others might find useful too?
