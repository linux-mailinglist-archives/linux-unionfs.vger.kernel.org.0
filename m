That is an *idea* described by hand waving.
That is not a threat I can seriously comment on.
How exactly is that USB auto mounted? where to?
How is that related to overlay?

Because cluttering the user with more and more config options for
minor and mostly unimportant behaviors is not ideal either.
See what Kconfig help has to say about the config option:

config OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_ALWAYS_FOLLOW
        bool "Overlayfs: follow redirects even if redirects are turned off"
        default y

       Disable this to get a possibly more secure configuration, but that
       might not be backward compatible with previous kernels.

That is a VERY generic description that fits not following origin very
well IMO, and not following unverified dir origin as well for that matter.
Nobody outside overlayfs developers knows what "redirects" means
anyway. To me, following non-dir origin sounds exactly the same
as following non-dir metacopy redirect or dir redirect. It's just the
implementation details that differ.

So my claim is that we *can* piggyback on it because I really
don't believe anybody is using this config out there for anything
other than "to be on the safe side".

But I do not make the calls here and it doesn't look like I managed
to convince you to take my side of the argument :-)

Thanks,
Amir.
