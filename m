You are right. Literally it does.
But if prospect users are ok with upgrading libmount and if that
solves the problem, I'd rather not have to carry in the kernel
baggage code to support old mount API for a very niche use case.

I am also confused by this reaction.
Who said that I do not want to provide the _unenc API?

IIUC, you are requesting a new feature that did not exist before,
namely, upperdir_unenc, workdir_unenc, lowerdir_unenc options.
Did I understand correctly?
If that is the case then please send a patch to support
those new options in the new mount API only
including documentation and tests.

Thanks,
Amir.
