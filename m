Don't think it is worth it.
It is a corner case of a special case.

1) is not problematic IMO and the simple patch I posted may be applied
for fixing the reported issue, but it only solved the special case of null uuid.
The problem still exists with re-creating lower on xfs/ext4, e.g. by
rm -rf and unpacking image tar.

So either we solve only the special case and wait for someone to complain
on the non-null uuid case or we try to make the code more robust.

Suggesting improvement for auto detecting re-created lower:
- On mount, even with index disabled, do ovl_verify_origin() of lower root
- On lookup of dir, do ovl_verify_origin() regardless of ovl_verify_lower()
- When ovl_verify_origin() on some dir fails and index/metacopy are disabled,
  warn and set ofs->bad_origin to disable ovl_check_origin() from here on
- Maybe also set null fh in ovl_set_origin() from here on?
- In ovl_dentry_*revalidate(), if non-dir has lower and ofs->bad_origin,
  invalidate the dentry
- Can also set ofs->bad_origin on ovl_verify_inode() for conflicting
  upper inode as reported in the bug

Thanks,
Amir.
