Miklos, I'm still learning a bit more about fs implementations, so my
apologies if this should be obvious. For virtio-fs, one of the use cases
that is described is sharing memory between two guests (not necessarily
the Kata use case). I was guessing the dcache would be within the guest,
and that in at least the shared memory case, there's potential that a 
revalidate may be neccesary, in case any changes are made by the second guest?
(I could be mixing up the intended use for revalidate, though).

Can you clarify that "not calling ->revalidate() should not be a
problem?"

Thanks for the help.

-Eric
