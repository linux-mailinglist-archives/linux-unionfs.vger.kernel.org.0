If I can specify lower and upper root, then why do I need to specify
base directory. User can put lower, upper either on samefs or different
fs as need be.

IOW, either I need to specify base dir, so that lower and upper can
be setup by testsuite automatically. Or I need to specify lower and
upper and then base should not matter.

What am I missing.

Ok.

No, I don't have any requirements yet. Just thought that providing
extra flexibility will be good. At the same time I understand that
tests are tied to specific config, hence mount options. If we allow
override, suddenly many tests will start failing.

Yes. Thanks.
