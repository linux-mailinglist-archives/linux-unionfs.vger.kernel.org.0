My entire problem is that you break user space. Either fix the
regression and *continue* fixing regressions instead of hoping that no
one complains enough and escalates things, or give us another API
where you can actually make that guarantee. The current way is simply
not workable.

Even if we'd accept this regression (and thus regress our user space
to not handle any paths any more), the commitment to keeping the API
stable in this thread has been "we'll try" instead of a "yes,
absolutely" and that makes me worry as well.
