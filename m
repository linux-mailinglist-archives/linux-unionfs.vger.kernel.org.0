Sorry, it took some time to elaborate this proposal, but I think it is
mostly correct. I even tried it (as an experiment, we didn't make any
decision yet).

So, the basic idea is to use the stacked IMA calls I proposed (by
adding security_file_post_open() in backing-file.c, and evaluate each
layer independently.

The policy match on each IMA call will be on the overlayfs inode, so
that we see the same metadata as the process opening the file, but we
attach the state to the real inode (regardless of the layer).

Violations are going to work because there is no layer mismatch (write
on one layer, read on a different layer), they are checked always on
the real inode. Since overlayfs has to always open the real inode,
i_write/readcount will be always incremented.

If there is a match at one layer, IMA is not going to process the file
again, since the result is cached from the previous IMA call.

i_version comparison will also be on the real inode, no need to provide
one on overlayfs.

Invalidation (like by setting security.ima) will happen on the real
inode.

I went even further, to think that when we check the authenticity of
security.ima with EVM we can pass the real inode, but we are not sure
yet.

We will continue to validate this proposal.

Thanks
