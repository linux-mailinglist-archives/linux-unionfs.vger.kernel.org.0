This seems like a wrong use case to me. So in above example, say
following happens.

- Mount overlay
- modify sshd_config (it gets copied up).
- Lower squahsfs gets updated and /etc/sshd/sshd_config gets updated.
- Mount overlay and user now sees old copied up sshd_config. (If it
  works).

Conceptually it is not making much sense to me. What's the point of
upgrading lower because after mounting overlay you might still see
old file. And to make it worse, behavior is underministic beacuse
if file has not been copied up, you will see new file.

To me, this sounds like a volatile overlay use case. Any changes to
overlay should be thrown away when lower sqashfs is updated and a
fresh upper should be set.

Thanks
Vivek
