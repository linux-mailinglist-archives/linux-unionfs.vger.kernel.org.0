So there seem to two cases. One is copying the lower layers to same
filesystem or a different filesystem. And another case is recreating
the lower layers and use previous upper with old upper. IIUC, we
are currently facing problem with second scenario.

"copying the lower layers" is probably fine as you said because old
tree still keeps that inode number busy and newly created inode
should not acquire that number. 

But in this case looks like we recreated lower and that led to 
some file B acquiring an inode number which was used by A. So
this is a different use case. IIUC, simply copying the layer
will not lead to this situation.

Now question is do we support recreating the lower layer with existing
upper. And I see following text in "Sharing and copying layer"

"Mounting an overlay using an upper layer path, where the upper layer path
was previously used by another mounted overlay in combination with a
different lower layer path, is allowed, unless the "inodes index" feature
or "metadata only copy up" feature is enabled."

This seems to suggest that recreating lower layer is allowed as long
as you are not using index or metacopy feature. 

If that's the case, probably "origin" should have been an opt-in
feature or automatically be enabled by some other opt-in feature.

So discrepancy is still possible if somebody modifies lower layers
without changing lower root.

- Copy up file A.
- Unmount overlay
- unlink A
- create B (assume B gets same inode number as A).
- mount overlay; B gets copied up.

And now we have both upper A and B having same origin despite no
hardlink. Am I understanding it right?

Is there a good use case for allowing modifying lower layers with
same upper. Given we are adding more complex features to overlayfs,
will it make sense to not allow modifying lower layer going forward.
We might not be able to detect it but atleast it will be unsupported
configuration. And then we can only focus to provide a work around
for existing use cases.

We don't allow modifying lower layers if metacopy is enabled.

"For "metadata only copy up" feature there is no verification mechanism at
mount time. So if same upper is mounted with different set of lower, mount
probably will succeed but expect the unexpected later on. So don't do it.
"

So if somebody is recreating lower or modifying lower with metacopy
on, its an unsupported configuration.
