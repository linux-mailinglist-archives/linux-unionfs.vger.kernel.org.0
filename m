As already responded, third (?) patch version was like that, gregkh@ 
said it passed the limit for number of arguments, is looking a bit silly 
(my paraphrase), and that it should be passed as a structure. Two others 
agreed. We gained because both set and get use the same structure after 
this change (this allows a simplified read-modify-write cycle).

We will need a quorum on this, 3 (structure) to 2 (flag) now (but really 
basically between Greg and Christoph?). Coding style issue: Add a flag, 
or switch to a common xattr argumentÂ  structure?

Yes, on an unnamed 4.19-based and mainline-based Android and virtual 
cuttlefish product ... which was critically unworkable without this 
patch series.

Please refer it in private email to me, no guarantees, my cycles are so 
sparse right now that it took a month to respin this patch series to 
upstream. If I can make it test on Android with overlayfs activated, big 
gain.
