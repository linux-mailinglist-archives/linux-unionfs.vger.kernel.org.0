I think it's gotten too late for 6.5.  If there is no 6.4-rc8, then the 6.5
merge window will open just 5 days from now.  This series has recently gone
through some significant changes, including in the version just sent out today
which I haven't had a chance to review yet.

Please don't try to rush things in when they involve UAPI and on-disk format
changes, which will have to be supported forever.  We need to take the time to
get them right.
 
I also see that the overlayfs tree is already very busy in 6.5, with the support
for data-only lower layers, lazy lookup of lowerdata, and the new mount API.

I think 6.6 would be a more realistic target.  That would give time to write
proper documentation as well, which is super important.  (Very often while
writing documentation, I realize that I should do something differently in the
code.  Please don't think of documentation as something can be done "later".)
