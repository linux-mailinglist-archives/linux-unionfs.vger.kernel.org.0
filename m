You know, I am not sure that building images requires syncing to disk.
Why is syncfs() needed between unmount and copying/tar'ing the layers?
Why is it needed before mounting again? It is not.
It is only needed "before crash", so whether or not "dirty volatile" overlay
can be mounted is a decision better be made by userspace.

The only problem with this approach is that it is a bit harder to document
the filesystem behavior, but I think that we need to.

I agree.
Miklos accepted $workdir/work/incompat/volatile/dirty.
I assume the name 'dirty'/'donotremove' is not an issue.
It's simple.
Let's go with that.

Thanks,
Amir.
