That isn't an accurate summary of what I said.  I actually pointed out two
specific things that are confusing specifically in the context of this feature.

And that was a third specific thing.  I got a detailed response back
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-unionfs/CAL7ro1GGAfdZG9cHDWE2vnhY5tSE=9MxYi_n_gJHRfaw7zMSgg@mail.gmail.com),
which was helpful.  Unfortunately, the information in that response hasn't yet
found its way into the documentation that is being proposed.

In general the proposed documentation reads like the audience is overlayfs
developers.  It doesn't describe the motivation for the feature or how to use it
in each of the two use cases.  Maybe that is intended, but it's not what I had
expected to see.

Side note: the use of the passive voice, e.g. "the xattr may be set" and "the
xattr may then be used to verify", should be avoided since it makes it unclear
who/what is doing these actions.
