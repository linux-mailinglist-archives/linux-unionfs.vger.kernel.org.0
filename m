That is exactly the case with package managers that update system
files, except package managers can prompt user to resolve conflicts.

Think of this is a package manager that manages a single package
called "system". If that package manager (usually called firmware upgrade)
wanted to, it could compare for every upper file to origin from system image A
and to same path from system image B before making the upgrade and
prompt the user to resolve the conflict just like a regular package manager.

But if said package manager does not resolve conflicts it is the same as
a package manager configured to auto resolve conflicts by choosing the
local modification. Not perfect, but people do live with such setups even
without overlayfs.

Thanks,
Amir.
