Things are not that rosy for this.

First of all, the default value for OVERLAY_FS_XINO_AUTO is no, so by
default xino is not enabled. This means that overlay.whiteout only
works if you enable xino=3Don/auto in the mount.

Secondly, in the case where all upper and lower are on the same fs,
even if xino is enabled it is ignored. This is not the  case where the
lower is on a nested  overlayfs as you say, but maybe we want to
create a lower dir that works on both when stored on a overlayfs and
elsewere. Relying on xino which is essentially unrelated to whiteouts
to get enabled seems quite fragile.

I'm gonna instead try to make the alternative whiteout be a fifo with
an xattr. Then we can add DT_FIFO to the maybe_whiteout case during
readdir() which will then get picked up as a whiteout without relying
on xino.

I still have an issue with this approach though. Suppose we have a
rootfs that we want to make available as an overlayfs lower (using
trusted.overlay.*). We can escape all the xattrs in the rootfs with
trusted.overlay.overlay to make them show up correctly. However,
suppose the rootfs contains a char(0.0) whiteout. how do we encode
this? We can use a file with trusted.overlay.overlay.whiteout, which
then will be visible as trusted.overlay.whiteout in the overlayfs
mount. This is normally functionally equivalent to the char(0,0)
whiteout, but not if the user of the rootfs mounts the second
overlayfs using userxattr.

Maybe it could convert a char(0,0) to a file with both
trusted.overlay.overlay.whiteout and user.overlay.whiteout? The the
resulting overlayfs file could be used as a whiteout for both types,
just like the char node...
