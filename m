My own slight concern about this is that:

Previously, all metacopy inodes shares a common EROFS shared xattr
which can be cached in memory once when the first read and other
inodes won't trigger any I/Os for this.

If "overlay.metacopy" xattr is not empty thus it cannot be shared,
I guess at least you could place it into an EROFS inline xattr, that
may be good as well if you also keep "header + flags".

But I'm not sure if it's a good idea to keep the full fsverity
digest in "overlay.metacopy" honestly, especially overlayfs
fsverity feature is off.  That will amplify I/Os (which could be
landed in EROFS shared xattrs as "overlay.digest" in the past and
now we need to read it immediately.)

Especially for the "ls -lR" workload, I guess you might need to
evaluate this way (only add flags vs flags + digest in
"overlay.metacopy") first.
