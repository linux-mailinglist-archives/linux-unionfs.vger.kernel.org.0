I could add some more background to this, assuming layer 0 is a
baseos layer (e.g. almost all images use this layer); and layer 1 +
layer 2 belongs to some specific workload images;

since layer 1 + layer 2 are always used together, so we could merge
layer 1 + layer 2 as a new merged layer to avoid extra overhead of
too many overlay layer dirs (but to simplify, here we just illustrate
layer 1 and layer 2, there could be layer 3, 4, ...), but layer 1 +
layer 2 has no relationship with layer 0 in principle (in principle,
merge tool doesn't need to know if layer 0 or any underlay layer
exists).

So if we merge layer 1 + layer 2 here first, and use layer0 together
with the merged layer, it could generate such whiteout cases
described before.

Anyway, we could work around this in the merge tool, but I'm not
sure if it's a design constaint of overlayfs.
