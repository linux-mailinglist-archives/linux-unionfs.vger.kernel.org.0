I wouldn't call it "incorrect" more like "unnecessary".

It would be nice, but somebody needs to care enough to implement it
and it is not going to be trivial, because error on lookup is much easier
then selective error on a "broken" dentry depending on the operation...

You are not the only one, I hear of many users that do that, but nobody ever
bothered to sit down and document the requirements - what exactly is the
use case and what is the expected outcome.

The truth is that this documentation is old, before all the new features
were added. See here [1], Vivek suggested:
"Modifying/recreating lower layer only works when
 metacopy/index/nfs_export are not enabled at any point of time. This
 also will change inode number reporting behavior."

With metacopy/index/nfs_export/redirect_dir disabled code behaves mostly
like it did at the time that this documentation was written, so I guess you may
say that changes are permitted and result in "defined" behavior.

It seems fine to me.

Thanks,
Amir.
