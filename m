The link above seems just my mail thread in mail list.

Seems the use case is sightly different with ours, in our use case,
we hope to skip sync behavior in overlayfs layer(sometimes there will be 
still syncing behavior triggered by wirteback of upper lyaer) for 
certain kind of containers(I don't mean all kind of containers).

Optimization of syncfs will mitigate the effect of sync behavior but 
maybe directly skipping dirty date syncing is better for special use case.
