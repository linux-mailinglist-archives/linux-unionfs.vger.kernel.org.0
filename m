It does look nicer :)
I gave you a small review comment on github, but overall looks good.

When you are done testing, please post v3 patches.

Note that I pushed a new version of ovl-lazy-lowerdata branch to
fstests, with the minor :: syntax change.

Not sure if Miklos will have time to review them this cycle or wait
for the next one.

There are also the mount api changes from Christian that conflict
with the new verify option.

If we want to have all of these changes for this cycle, some collaboration
will be required.

Thanks,
Amir.
