yes, it is definitely something we are looking into.  For fuse-overlayfs
(a FUSE implementation of overlay used for unprivileged containers), we
already expose an option to disable sync and we use it for build
containers.

For root containers, we are currently looking at other solutions like a
custom seccomp profile, but the mount flag would be a better solution.
