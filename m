That makes the test I posted wrong, because it expects the
dir modifications to be visible after seek to 0.

The thing is, unlike readdir(3) implementation, overlayfs keeps the
readdir cache on the inode, so by keeping the original fd open
and opening a new fd, I could reproduce stale and missing entries
for a new opendir, which is definitely a bug.

Will post the updated test.

Amir.
