no, without forgetting them.
The original idea was to have a way to disable any sync operation in the
overlay file system and let the upper layers handle it.  IOW, mount
volatile overlay+umount overlay+syncfs upper dir must still be
considered safe.
If we want to make it safer and disallow remounting the same
workdir+upperdir by default when "volatile" is used, that is fine; but I
think there should still be a way to say "I know what I am doing, just
remount it".
