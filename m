For full backward compatibility we would probably need to fix both the
kernel and libmount. Because libmount/mount(8) is encouraged to split a
lowerdir=/a:/b:/c:/d option into separate fsconfig calls, especially
when dealing with really long paths. So libmount would need to be aware
of overlayfs parsing behavior that includes escaping \, even if we fix
the kernel itself.

I don't think that would be a big deal because libmount already has to
deal with all kinds of filesystems specific quirks.

However, libmount also added LIBMOUNT_FORCE_MOUNT2={always,never,auto}
which can be used to disable using the new mount api and makes it use
the old mount api which is available in libmount 2.39.

So I think complementing overlayfs with a ->parse_monolithic() option
might be something that we could consider doing but this is a judgement
call there's not clear right and wrong with so many moving parts...

I'm pretty sure that this would break something so I would be hesitant
doing this.
