I can confirm the root dentry issue is fixed and I now see a lot less
ENOENTs hitting the lower (NFS) directory. For my test case, we go
from ~80,000 -> 27,000 ENOENTs, a great improvement.

However I was still seeing some lookups hitting the lower layer in
directories that had opaque=z. After a bit of testing and much head
scratching, it seems like you need to do something like "ls
/olv/blah/thing/version/lib" to force a readdir of the lower NFS
filesystem (after remount) to reliably stop the lookups hitting the
lower filesystem.

For example, after doing the steps to copy up metadata and set
opaque=z, we then remount and test the effect:

chown -R -h bob /olv/blah/thing/version/lib
ls -lR  /ovl/blah/thing/version/lib
umount /ovl
mount /ovl
for x in {1..10}; do stat /olv/blah/thing/version/lib/${RANDOM};done

This will always send the lookup to the lower level. But if we do:

ls -l /olv/blah/thing/version/lib
for x in {1..10}; do stat /olv/blah/thing/version/lib/${RANDOM}.so;done

this triggers a readdir of the lower NFS dir and then the random file
lookups only hit the upper layer as expected.

So then I'm not entirely clear why in my real world test *most* of the
negative lookups are served by the upper level but some are not. I can
only think that loading software *mostly* triggers READDIRs on things
like lib dirs, but not always?

It may also be complicated by the fact that we often have symlinks at
various points in the path too (both dir & file).

Right... for some reason I thought it only needed st_size which it
could get from the sparse file.

Yea, that makes sense to me.

I'll draft up something for review and I'll try to keep it concise.

Bear with me... I'll have a look and see if I can figure it out.

Understood. However, I do suspect that some are using this "undefined
behaviour" because it worked for their use case. This patch might ruin
their day?
