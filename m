It's *empty* redirected files that cause the alleged problem.
If files were not empty, the EIO would have been expected, because...

Suppose this was:
echo 123 >  lower/foo.txt

...this mv does not copy up "123" to foo.txt before renaming it to bar.txt...

Yes.
What would you expect to happen when data of metacopy file has been removed?

> I didn't see any tests covering it in

We have some tests in xfstests to prove that modifying underlying
layers does not
result in a crash, but otherwise the behavior is undefined, so it is
hard to write tests.
There is some code and tests in place for better behavior on
underlying file changes
like not exposing whiteouts in upper dir when lower dir was removed.

I guess the only thing we could document is that changes to underlying
layers with metacopy and redirects have undefined results.
Vivek was a proponent of making the statements about outcome of
changes to underlying layers sound more harsh.

There are a handful of places in overlayfs where returning EIO is
combined with informative pr_warn_ratelimited().
You can see some examples in ovl_lookup(), which is where the reported
EIO is coming from:
        if (d.metacopy || (uppermetacopy && !ctr)) {
                err = -EIO;


Having said all that, metacopy and redirects on lower empty files seems
like an unintentional outcome.

If you care about this use case particularly, you may try this untested patch:

Thanks,
Amir.
