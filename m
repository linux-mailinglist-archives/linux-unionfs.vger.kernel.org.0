Good observation!  I think you are right.  After a bit of testing, I did
not notice any issues after making offline changes to lower with xino
enabled.

To be clear, are you saying that offline modifications to directories in
lower layers which are the redirection target of an upper layer does not
cause undefined behavior?  Would it make sense for me to work up a patch
which documents the behavior, or is it better to leave as "defined but
undocumented"?

My understanding of the current behavior:

1. If a redirection target dir is removed from lower, contents which do
   not exist in any upper are removed from the redirected dir in the
   overlay.  Contents which exist in an upper are unchanged.
2. If a redirection target dir is renamed in lower, it has the same
   effect as removing the directory with the old name and creating one
   with the new name and contents.
3. Permission changes to a redirection target dir have no effect in the
   overlay.
4. If a previously removed redirection target dir is created, its
   contents are added to the redirected dir in the overlay, unless the
   redirected dir had been renamed after removal, in which case it is
   ignored (because the redirected dir becomes opaque when renamed).
5. If a file with the name of a previously removed redirection target
   dir is created, it is ignored.

The only behavior which seems a bit surprising to me is #4:  If
directory B in upper is redirected to A in lower and A is subsequently
removed, then (possibly years later) a directory named A is created, its
contents would appear in B in the overlay.  However, if B had been
renamed to C after A was removed, it becomes opaque, causing A and its
contents not to appear in the overlay.  Either of these may surprise
users.

Does that match your understanding of the current behavior?  Worth
documenting or better to just remove redirect_dir from the list of
features where offline modification causes undefined behavior?

Thanks,
Kevin
