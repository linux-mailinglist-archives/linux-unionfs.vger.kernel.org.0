It might not make much sense to you, but it's EXACTLY what I need.
This OverlayFS is used *only* for permanent configuration.
Most of the times I'm adding new files (like host certificates and
similar things), but sometimes applications provide "default
configuration" I might need to override.
If/when applications "upgrade their defaults" I definitely do not
want them to override my choices.

I beg to differ.
While You are right in the general case it's possible to end up with
a tangled mess of old/new files none can sort out, your solution
resembles a lot to Alexander "solution" of the gordian knot.

In practice problems can (and will) arise in development
when most of changes are done by hand for testing (so some
unwanted "permanent" change can creep in; in production
there's a well defined flow that should prevent mishap.

Some of those configurations could be handled via other means,
but they are invariably more complex and less adaptable to
"unforeseen" needs/changes (which *will* happen).
