Ok, here are two approaches:

A fifo with overlay.whiteout is treated as an alternative kind of whiteout:
  https://github.com/alexlarsson/linux/commit/8392cac01ef10cd9ad53203fb3c7b=
381e1ecae26

A fifo with overlay.whiteout is treated gets "unescaped" to a regular white=
out:
  https://github.com/alexlarsson/linux/commit/7d7f77c1541f60213abc00412c176=
a47fd5bc046

Opinions on these? I like the second one better.
