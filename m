It still seems odd and I'm not sure you won't end up with weird corner
cases due to the flag handling. If you're doing this in the new
f_op->syncfs, then why bother with sb->s_wb_err at all? You can just do
this, and avoid the overlayfs sb altogether:

if (errseq_check(&upper_sb->s_wb_err, file->f_sb_err)) {
	/* Upper sb has errors since last time */
	spin_lock(&file->f_lock);
	errseq_check_and_advance(&upper_sb->s_wb_err, &file->f_sb_err);
	spin_unlock(&file->f_lock);
}

That's simpler than trying to propagate the error between two
errseq_t's. You would need to sample the upper_sb->s_wb_err at
open time in the overlayfs ->open handler though, to make sure
you're tracking the right one.

Good point. I was thinking about the newer code that may mark it
OBSERVED when you sample at open time.

Still, I think working with the overlayfs sb->s_wb_err is just adding
complexity for little benefit.  Assuming that writeback errors can only
happen on the upper layer, you're better off avoiding it.
